Considering the benefits offered by a laparoscopic magnified caudo-dorsal view, we devised and standardized an LDP procedure for PC, which we employed in five patients with left-sided resectable tumors. First, the retroperitoneum was incised between the proximal jejunum and the inferior mesenteric vein with the transverse colon pushed up ventrally and cranially and with the proximal jejunum moved to the right. Then, the left renal vein (LRV) could be easily identified at this site. The retroperitoneal tissue was dissected along the LRV, and the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) also was identified just above the LRV easily. The left adrenal gland was removed to secure the dorsal margin, if needed. The retroperitoneal dissection was continued along the major anatomical landmarks, including the LRV, the left renal artery, the left kidney, and the crus of the diaphragm beside the origin of the SMA. Using the same operative field, lymphadenectomy around the SMA was performed before dividing the pancreas. We could safely and easily expose the left aspect of the SMA after dissecting the ligament of Treitz. The dissection around the SMA was performed toward the side of the arterial root that had already been exposed above the LRV. Thus, the most important difficult steps of LDP for PC, such as retroperitoneal dissection and lymphadenectomy around the SMA, were safely performed early in the operation with a good laparoscopic view. The median operative time was 341 (range 288-354) minutes, and median blood loss was 150 (range 50-150) ml. An intraoperative transfusion was not required for any patient. Severe postoperative complications or mortality were absent. An R0 resection was achieved in all patients. LDP using the &quot;caudo-dorsal artery first approach&quot; is safe and useful for performing a minimally invasive, curative resection for left-sided PC.";"2019";"Annals of surgical oncology";NA

This retrospective study included 50 patients who underwent open surgery and 44 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for obstructing left-sided colon cancer at four tertiary referral hospitals between June 2005 and December 2013. The median follow-up periods were 48Â months and 47Â months in the open and laparoscopic groups, respectively. The median operative time, time to soft diet, and length of stay were comparable between the groups. Four cases converted to open surgery (9.1%) in the laparoscopic group. The morbidity within 30Â days after surgery was comparable between the groups (OR 0.931; 95% CI 0.357-2.426; pâ€‰=â€‰0.884). The proximal and distal resection margins, the histologic grade of tumor, TNM stage, median tumor size, and presence of lymphovascular invasion did not differ significantly between the groups. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of the open and laparoscopic groups were 67.1% and 71.7% (HR 1.028, 95% CI 0.491-2.15, pâ€‰=â€‰0.942) and the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 55.8% and 61.5% (HR 0.982; 95% CI 0.522-1.847; pâ€‰=â€‰0.955), respectively. The recurrence pattern did not differ between the groups. Multivariate analysis showed that sex (pâ€‰=â€‰0.027), nodal stage (pâ€‰=â€‰0.043), and the proportion of patients receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) were independent prognostic factors for OS. The proportion of patients receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) was an independent prognostic factor for DFS. Laparoscopic resection following stent insertion for obstructing colon cancer can be performed safely, with long-term oncologic outcomes comparable with those of open surgery.";"2019";"Surgical endoscopy";"Colonic neoplasm; Laparoscopy; Outcome; Stent"

This prespecified retrospective analysis included 199 evaluable patients with <i>RAS</i>/<i>BRAF</i> wt. The PRESSING panel included the following: immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization for <i>HER2/MET</i> amplification, IHC with or without RNA sequencing for <i>ALK/ROS1/NTRKs/RET</i> fusions, next-generation sequencing for <i>HER2</i>/<i>PIK3CAex.20/PTEN</i>/<i>AKT1</i> and <i>RAS</i> mutations with low mutant allele fraction, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for microsatellite instability. PRESSING status (any positive biomarker <i>v</i> all negative) and sidedness were correlated with overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in the study population and by treatment arm. Overall, left- and right-sided tumors were 85.4% and 14.6%, respectively, and PRESSING-negative and -positive tumors were 75.4% and 24.6%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 26 months, inferior outcomes were consistently observed in right- versus left-sided tumors for ORR (55.2% <i>v</i> 74.1%; <i>P</i> = .037), PFS (8.4 <i>v</i> 11.5 months; <i>P</i> = .026), and OS (2-year rate: 50.2% <i>v</i> 65.1%; <i>P</i> = .062).

In this article, we present D3 extended mesenterectomy: a surgical technique that excises the lymphatic tissue en bloc with the right colectomy specimen. A 3D map of the mesentery of the right colon was reconstructed from staging CT-angiogram scans. The surgical technique of right colectomy with D3 extended mesenterectomy consisted of eight steps: 1) reveal the SMV and SMA; 2) isolate the ileocolic artery; 3) isolate the middle colic artery; 4) resolve the anterior mesenteric flap; 5) specimen de-vascularization; 6) colectomy; 7) resolve the posterior mesenteric flap; and 8) anastomosis. One-hundred-seventy-six patients (77 men) 66 years of age were operated upon from February 2011 to January 2017. There were 169 adenocarcinomas: 16.0% Stage I, 49.1% Stage II, 33.7% Stage III, 1.2% Stage IV. Tumor locations were 50.6% cecum, 41.5% ascending colon, 4.5% hepatic flexure, and 2.3% transverse colon. Mean operating time was 200 minutes, blood loss 273 ml, and length of stay 7.9 days. There were 9 anastomotic leakages and 15 reoperations. One patient underwent small bowel resection due to SMA tear. There was no postoperative mortality. The mean number of lymph nodes per specimen (40.9) was comprised of 27.1 in the D2 volume and 13.8 in the D3 volume. The mean number of metastatic lymph nodes was 1.2 in the D2 volume and 0.13 in D3. There were 7 patients with lymph node metastasis in D3, 2 of whom had node metastasis solely within D3. This study shows that 1.2% of patients would have been incorrectly diagnosed as Stage II if extended D3 mesenterectomy had not been performed. Similarly, lymph node metastases would have been left behind in 4.1% of patients if extended D3 mesenterectomy had not been performed.";"2019";"Surgical technology international";NA

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we extracted patients diagnosed with stage IV CAC between 2010 and 2016. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted with log-rank tests to compare overall survival (OS) of patients with different metastatic patterns. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the effects of different metastatic patterns on survival outcomes in terms of OS and disease-specific survival (DSS). A total of 26Â 170 patients were analyzed. The 3- and 5-year OS were 20.7% and 10.5%, respectively, for patients with stage IV CAC. The most common distant metastatic site was the liver, followed by the lung, bone, and brain, but the frequency differed greatly by histology subtypes. The site of metastasis was a significant prognostic factor for OS and DSS in patients with stage IV CAC, independent of the number of metastatic sites and other clinical and demographic prognostic factors. Using liver-only metastasis as reference, lung-only metastasis was associated with better OS (hazard ratio [HR]Â =Â 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.94) and DSS (HRÂ =Â 0.75, 95% CI, 0.64-0.88). Older age, black race, unmarried status, grade III/IV tumors, advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, proximal colon, elevated preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), no surgery of the primary site, and no chemotherapy were independent predictors of poor OS. The site of distant metastasis and number of metastasis site were independent prognostic factors for survival of patients with stage IV CAC.

We did a population-based cohort study involving prospective data collected from four hospitals in Denmark. We compared the oncological outcome data of patients at one centre performing central lymph node dissection and vascular division after almost complete exposure of the proximal part of the superior mesenteric vein (ie, the complete mesocolic excision group) with three other centres performing conventional resections with unstandardised and limited lymph node dissection (ie, non-complete mesocolic excision; control group). We included data for all patients in the Capital Region of Denmark undergoing elective curative-intent right-sided colon resections for stages I-III colon cancer, as categorised by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC; 5th edition), from June 1, 2008, to Dec 31, 2013. Patients were followed-up for 5Â·2 years after surgery. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of recurrence after 5Â·2 years of surgery. Inverse probability of treatment weighting and competing risk analyses were used to estimate the possible causal effects of complete mesocolic excision. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03754075. 1069 patients (813 in the control group and 256 in the complete mesocolic excision group) underwent curative-intent elective surgery for right-sided colon cancer during the study period. None of the patients were lost to follow-up regarding survival or recurrence status, and consequently no patient was censored in the analyses. The 5Â·2-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 9Â·7% (95% CI 6Â·3-13Â·1) in the complete mesocolic excision group compared with 17Â·9% (15Â·3-20Â·5) in the control group, and the absolute risk reduction of complete mesocolic excision after 5Â·2 years was 8Â·2% (95% CI 4Â·0-12Â·4; p=0Â·00015). In the control group, 145 (18%) of 813 patients were diagnosed with a recurrence and 281 (35%) died during follow-up, whereas in the complete mesocolic excision group 25 (10%) of 256 patients were diagnosed with a recurrence and 75 (29%) died during follow-up. This study shows a causal treatment effect of central mesocolic lymph node excision on risk of recurrence after resection for right-sided colon adenocarcinoma.

The analysis was performed for progression-free survival and overall survival according to the sidedness and other known prognostic factors. Out of 53 patients treated with triplet therapy, 11 had right sided and 42 had left-sided primaries. The median age for right-sided primaries was 46 (range 24-55) compared to 53 (range 32-74) in left-sided primaries. Median progression-free survival was 14 months for right vs 18 months for left sided tumors (Hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.27-1.88, p=0.492) and median overall survival was 21 months for right vs 29 months for left sided tumors (Hazard ratio was 0.86, 95% CI 0.32-2.26, p=0.752).

Determination of MSI in stage II CRC is important for management decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy administration. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic and predictive significance of MSI in stage 2 CRC in the Indian scenario. A total of 195 patients who underwent curative surgery for stage II CRC from 2010 to 2017 were included. MSI testing by immunohistochemistry (DNA MisMatch Repair proteins) was performed in all. Various clinicopathological factors and disease-free survival and overall survival were assessed between MSI and MSS groups. The effect of treatment in terms of survival benefits with adjuvant therapy in the MSI group was also assessed. 27.1% of the CRCs' showed MSI. Younger age (&lt;50 years), family history of cancer, synchronous/metachronous malignancies, proximal (right sided) location, poor morphological tumour differentiation, mucin production, and presence of peritumoral (Crohn's-like) lymphocytic response showed statistically significant association with MSI. Majority (56%) of our patients showed combined loss of MLH1 and PMS2. Overall, survival among the MSI patients was significantly higher (76.6 Â± 4.149 months) than the MSS patients (65.05 Â± 3.555)P= 0.04.

There has been increasing interest in adopting this technology to colorectal surgery and this has recently been introduced to the Irish health system. This paper gives an account of our early institutional experience with adoption of robotic colorectal surgery using structured training. Analysis was conducted of a prospectively maintained database of our first 55 consecutive robotic colorectal cases, performed by four colorectal surgeons, each at the beginning of his robotic surgery experience, using the Da Vinci Si<sup>Â®</sup> system and undergoing training as per the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgery (EARCS) programme. Overall surgical and oncological outcomes were interrogated. Fifty-five patients underwent robotic surgery between January 2017 and January 2018, M:F 34:21, median age (range) 60 (35-87)Â years. Thirty-three patients had colorectal cancer and 22 had benign pathologies. Eleven rectal cancer patients had neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. BMI was &gt;â€‰30 in 21.8% of patients and 56.4% of patients had previous abdominal surgery. Operative procedures performed were low anterior resection (nâ€‰=â€‰19), sigmoid colectomy (nâ€‰=â€‰9), right colectomy (nâ€‰=â€‰22), ventral mesh rectopexy (nâ€‰=â€‰3), abdominoperineal resection (nâ€‰=â€‰1) and reversal of Hartmann's procedure (nâ€‰=â€‰1). Median blood loss was 40Â ml (range 0-400). Mean operative time (minutes) was 233 (SD 79) for right colectomy and 368 (SD 105) for anterior resection. Median length of hospital stay was 6Â days (IQR 5-7). There was no 30-day mortality, intraoperative complications, conversion to laparoscopic or open, or anastomotic leakage. Median lymph nodes harvest was 15 in non-neoadjuvant cases (range 7-23) and 8 in neoadjuvant cases (2-14). Our early results demonstrate that colorectal robotic surgery can be adopted safely for both benign and neoplastic conditions using a structured training programme without compromising clinical or oncological outcomes.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) in patients receiving TAS-102 plus bevacizumab. The study included 17 patients (12 men and 5 women, mean age 60.4Â±13.4 years) with unresectable mCRC who were confirmed to have wild-type or mutant RAS genes. The patients received salvage-line treatment with TAS-102 plus bevacizumab at the Surgical Oncology Department of Gifu University School of Medicine between March 2016 and August 2018. The study population was heavily pretreated; the majority of the patients (71%) had received â‰¥4 prior regimens and, in addition to fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, all had received bevacizumab (100%) and either cetuximab or panitumumab (47%). The RAS status was wild-type in 9 (53%) and mutant in 8 (47%) patients. The primary tumor locations included the right-sided colon in 5 patients (29%; cecum in 2 and transverse colon in 3 cases) and left-sided colorectum in 12 patients [71%; sigmoid colon in 4, rectosigmoid (Rs) in 4, and rectum above/below the peritoneal reflection (Ra/b) in 4 cases]. Metastatic sites included the liver in 15 (88%), lung in 13 (76%), lymph nodes in 7 (41%), and peritoneal dissemination in 5 (24%) patients. The number of metastatic sites was 1 in 3 (18%) and &gt;2 in 14 (82%) patients. Their first staging imaging scans (after 2 cycles of therapy) were available for review in all 17 patients. At first evaluation, 5 (29%) patients had progressive disease (PD), 12 (71%) had stable disease, and none had a partial response to TAS-102 plus bevacizumab. The median overall survival (OS) of 14.1 months and progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.8 months were comparable to the 11.2 and 5.6 months, respectively, in the C-TASK FORCE study. Upon considering three groups, namely mGPS 0, mGPS 1 and mGPS 2, the median PFS times were significantly different (mGPS 0 vs. mGPS 2, P=0.02; and mGPS 1 vs. mGPS 2, P=0.06). The median PFS times in the mGPS 0, 1 and 2 groups were 12.1, 4.8 and 2.3 months, respectively. Median OS was also significantly different (mGPS 0 vs. mGPS 2, P=0.01; and mGPS 1 vs. mGPS 2, P=0.04). The median OS times in the mGPS 0, 1 and 2 groups were 14.0, not reached, and 2 months, respectively. The present study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the TAS-102 plus bevacizumab combination as salvage-line treatment.

Neratinib is an oral, irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is clinically active in HER2-positive breast cancer. Diarrhea is the most common side effect of this potent anticancer drug and the reasons for this adverse effect are still largely unclear. We have recently shown that activation of the calcium-sensing Receptor (CaSR) can inhibit secretagogue-induced diarrhea in the colon, therefore we hypothesized that CaSR activation may also mitigate neratinib-induced diarrhea. Using an established ex vivo model of isolated intestinal segments, we investigated neratinib-induced fluid secretion and the ability of CaSR activation to abate the secretion. In our study, individual segments of the rat intestine (proximal, middle, distal small intestine, and colon) were procured and perfused intraluminally with various concentrations of neratinib (10, 50, 100Â nmol L<sup>-1</sup>). In a second set of comparison experiments, intraluminal calcium concentration was modulated (from 1.0 to 5.0 or 7.0Â mmol L<sup>-1</sup>), both pre- and during neratinib exposure. In a separate series of experiments R-568, a known calcimimetic was used CaSR activation and effect was compared to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (5.0 and 7.0Â mmol L<sup>-1</sup>). As a result, CaSR activation with elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (5.0 and 7.0Â mmol L<sup>-1</sup>) or R-568 markedly reduced neratinib-induced fluid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-exposure to elevated luminal calcium solutions (5.0 and 7.0Â mmol L<sup>-1</sup>) also prevented neratinib-induced fluid secretion. In conclusion, exposure to luminal neratinib resulted in a pronounced elevation in fluid secretion in the rat intestine. Increasing luminal calcium inhibits the neratinib-associated fluid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that CaSR activation may be a potent therapeutic target to reduce chemotherapy-associated diarrhea.";"2019";"Pharmacology research &amp; perspectives";"HER2; Nerlynxâ„¢; calcium; electrolytes; fluid secretion"

Patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer from a single-arm, open-label phase II study (NCT00508404) were included. Tumours located from the splenic flexure to rectum and in the caecum to transverse colon were defined as left- and right-sided, respectively. Baseline characteristics were summarised by primary tumour location and the effects of primary tumour location on outcomes-including objective response rate, resection rate, depth of response, duration of response and progression-free survival-were analysed. Progression-free survival and objective response rate were analysed by early tumour shrinkage status. Primary tumour location was determined in 52/69 (75%) patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer; 45 (87%) had left-sided disease. Median progression-free survival was longer in patients with left-sided tumours (11.2 vs. 7.2Â months for right-sided disease) and more of these patients experienced early tumour shrinkage â‰¥â€‰30% (53% vs. 29%).

The Oncotype Recurrence Score (RS) assay is a clinically validated predictor of recurrence risk in patients with stage II colorectal cancer (CRC). Previous studies had indicated that without adjuvant chemotherapy, CDX2-negative stage II CRC tumors are associated with a lower rate of disease-free survival than CDX2-positive stage II CRC tumors. We aimed to evaluate whether these two validated prognostic biomarkers may correlate with primary tumor location, and whether tumor location may reflect differential prognosis in stage II CRC. We retrospectively analyzed patients with T3 mismatch repair-proficient (MMR-P) stage II CRC for whom RS assay was performed. Pathological report was reviewed for exact primary tumor location and CDX2 immunostaining. RS and CDX2 expression were correlated with primary tumor location. The analysis included 1,147 patients with MMR-P stage II CRC (median age 69 years [range 29-93]). Tumor distribution across the colon was as follows: 46% (<i>n</i> = 551) were right-sided and 54% (<i>n</i> = 596) were left-sided. RS was higher in right-sided tumors (<i>p</i> = .01). The RS results gradually decreased across the colon (cecum, highest score; sigmoid, lowest score; <i>p</i> = .04). Right-sided tumors exhibited more CDX2-negative tumors (<i>p</i> = .07).

Using two previously established prognostic tools, the Oncotype DX assay and CDX2 expression, this study found that right-sided tumors may display worse prognosis compared with left-sided tumors in mismatch repair-proficient stage II CRC.

Extended resection (including distal pancreasectomy and/or splenectomy), has been often indicated for the treatment for the splenic flexure cancer, because the lymphatic drainage at this site is poorly defined and assumed as heterogeneous. Between January 2006 and May 2016, 103 patients with splenic flexure colon cancer were enrolled in the study. We evaluated the clinicopathological findings and outcomes of all patients and associated them to the different surgical treatment. Out of 103 selected cases an extended right hemicolectomy was performed in 22 (21.4%) patients, an extended left hemicolectomy in 24 (23.3%) patients, a segmental resection of the splenic flexure in 57 (55.3%) patients; the combined resection of adjacent organs showing tumor adherence was carried out in 11 (10.7%) patients. The tumor infiltrated near organs (T4) in 5 patients. No significant differences in complications were found among the three groups. In all groups no differences were found in the total number of harvested lymphnodes. After a median follow-up of 42 months, 30 recurrences and 19 deaths occurred (12 for tumor progression). There was no difference in overall and progression free survival among the three different surgical treatments. According to our results, the partial resection of splenic flexure was not associated with a worse prognosis and it was leading for a satisfactory oncological outcome.

Clinical outcome was evaluated as progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR). 1) mCRC patients with KRAS wt tumors had higher proportions of circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells among all T cells but also higher measures of T regulatory (Treg) cells such as absolute count and a higher proportion of Tregs in the CD4<sup>+</sup> subset. 2) A low proportion of circulating Tregs among CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, and a high CD8:Treg ratio at initiation of VEGF-targeting therapy, were associated with favorable clinical outcome. 3) In a subset of patients with primarily right-sided mCRC, superior PFS and OS were observed when the CD8:Treg ratio was high. The baseline level of circulating immune cells predicts clinical outcome of 1st-line treatment with the anti-VEGF angio/immunomodulatory agent bevacizumab. Circulating immune biomarkers, namely the CD8:Treg ratio, identified patients in the right-sided mCRC subgroup with favorable outcome following treatment with 1st-line anti-VEGF treatment.";"2019";"BMC cancer";"Anti-VEGF; Antitumor immune response; Metastatic colorectal cancer; Primary colorectal carcinoma sidedness; Regulatory T cells; T cell subsets"

We used tumor registry and electronic health record data to identify and characterize patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum from 2010 to 2014 at six US health systems in the patient outcomes to advance learning (PORTAL) network. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the distribution of tumor characteristics and treatment patterns in early-onset versus late-onset CRC. Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs comparing survival between early- and late-onset CRC patients. There were 1,424 early-onset and 10,810 late-onset CRC cases in our analyses. Compared to late-onset CRC, early-onset CRC was significantly associated with advanced-stage disease, high-grade histology, signet ring histology, and rectal or left colon location. After adjusting for differences in tumor and patient characteristics, early-onset patients were more likely than late-onset patients to haveâ€‰&gt;â€‰12 lymph nodes examined (OR 1.60, CI 1.37-1.87), to receive systemic therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) within 6Â months of diagnosis (OR 2.84, CI 2.40-3.37), and to have a reduced risk of CRC-specific death (HR 0.66, CI 0.56-0.79).

The clinicopathologic data of 5463 patients with stage III colon cancer were collected. The best cutoff for LNR as a prognostic indicator for patients with right and left colon cancer was studied separately.

The simultaneous laparoscopic approach to both colon cancer and liver metastases joins the advantages of mini-invasiveness to the one-stage approach. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> During the period from February 2011 to July 2017, a single surgeon performed 17 laparoscopic colorectal operations with simultaneous liver resection for CRC with SLM. Colorectal procedures included 9 rectal resections, 6 left colectomies, and 2 right colectomies. Associated hepatic resections included 1 left hepatectomy, 1 right posterior sectionectomy, 2 segmentectomies, and 13 wedge resections. We analyzed retrospectively the patient's short-term outcome and operative and oncologic results. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> There was no conversion to open surgery. Six patients (35%) had minor complications (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II), whereas only 2 patients (12%) had major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV) and no mortality occurred. The median time of discharge was 8.6 (range 5-36) days. We obtained 94% of R0 resection margin on the liver specimen and 100% of negative distal and circumferential margin in case of rectal resection. An average of 20 lymphnodes were retrieved in the colorectal specimen. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Simultaneous mini-invasive colorectal and liver resection is a challenging but feasible procedure. The advantages of treating primary cancer and metastases in the same recovery justify the morbidity rate, especially because the most of the complications are minor and no cases of mortality occurred. Further experience is needed to better understand how to reduce the morbidity rate.";"2019";"Journal of laparoendoscopic &amp; advanced surgical techniques.

Metastatic patients were excluded from analysis. Left sided CRCs were associated with a number of additional key prognostic markers including BRAFV600E wildtype status (P&lt;0.001), mismatch repair proficiency (p&lt;0.001), absence of peritumoral lymphocytic response (p = 0.001), high lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (p&lt;0.001) and low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p&lt;0.001). In primary analysis with 3067 patients, there was no statistical difference in sidedness in the univariate analysis (p = 0.291). Three further subgroup analyses were performed. In the first subgroup, only stage III patients were analyzed. In the second, patients with mismatch repair deficiency were removed. In the third, additional clinicopathologic variables known to be independently prognostic were added into analysis.

Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and cumulative recurrence at specific anatomic sites were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.

The AGITG MAX trial was a randomized study comparing capecitabine versus capecitabineÂ + bevacizumab versus capecitabineÂ + bevacizumabÂ + mitomycin C as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer. Patients were classified as having right-sided (caecum to transverse colon) or left-sided (descending colon to rectum) disease according to anatomic location. Baseline characteristics and previously described molecular profiles were compared by side of primary tumor. Survival outcomes were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier approach and proportional hazards regression modeling. Among the 471 patients, the location of primary tumor was known in 440 patients (93%). Molecular profile was known in 298 patients (63%). Twenty-eight percent had right-sided primary tumors. Major differences between right and left are as follows: female 49% versus 33% (PÂ &lt; .01), BRAF mutant 16% versus 3.5% (PÂ â‰¤ .001), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss 27.6% versus 53% (PÂ = .01).

Several factors including number and size of metastases and primary tumour lymph-node status have been linked to survival. The primary tumour location along the colo-rectum continuum (sidedness) was analysed in first-line chemotherapy trials, where right-sided CRCs showed decreased survival. This association has not yet been clearly established in patients undergoing resection for CRLM. Clinicopathological differences in CRLM resections according to sidedness in two Austrian centres (2003-2016) are described and survival is compared through Kaplan-Meier and multivariable analysis. A risk-score is presented with time-dependent receiver operating curve analysis and international validation in two major hepatobiliary centres. Furthermore, a systematic meta-analysis of studies on primary tumour location and survival after CRLM resection was performed. 259 patients underwent hepatectomy. Right-sided CRC patients (n = 59) more often had positive primary tumour lymph-nodes (76.3%/61.3%;p = 0.043) and RAS-mutations (60%/34.9%;p = 0.036).

As in studies on earlier-stage or unresected metastatic disease, tumor sidedness is an important prognostic factor in patient survival with liver metastasectomy. Clinical risk scores should include side of primary tumor.

It still remains a difficult operation due to the retroperitoneal location of the pancreas and limited experience and training with the procedure. In addition, complications such as bleeding or postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remain a problem. A standardized approach to LDP with stepwise graded compression technique for pancreatic transection has been utilized at a single center, and we sought to describe the technique and determine the outcomes. A review of all patients undergoing LDP by a clockwise approach including the graded compression technique from August 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017 was performed. An external audit was performed by the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group. Overall, 260 patients with a mean age and a BMI of 62.3 and 28, respectively, underwent LDP using this technique. Mean operative time and blood loss were 183Â min and 248Â mL, respectively,. Hand-assisted method and conversion to open were both 5%. Major morbidity and mortality were 9.2% and 0.4%, respectively,. POPF was noted in 8.1%. The technical steps include (1) mobilization of the splenic flexure of the colon and exposure of the pancreas, (2) dissection along the inferior edge of the pancreas and choosing the site for pancreatic division, (3) pancreatic parenchymal division using a progressive stepwise compression technique with staple line reinforcement, (4) ligation of the splenic vein and artery, (5) dissection along the superior edge of the pancreas and residual posterior attachments, and (6) mobilization of the spleen and specimen removal. LDP with a clockwise approach for dissection, combined with the progressive stepwise compression technique for pancreatic transection, resulted in excellent outcomes including a very low POPF rate.";"2019";"Surgical endoscopy";"Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy; Laparoscopy"

Most cases of CRC metastasis to the thyroid involve metastases to other organs as well, particularly the liver and/or lung. There are only three reports of CRC metastasizing to the thyroid without involvement of another site. Patients with solitary thyroid metastasis from CRC have a poor prognosis after surgery, whereas resection is beneficial in their counterparts with a solitary liver or lung metastasis. This difference could be the result of delayed diagnosis of thyroid metastasis in patients with CRC, given that postoperative follow-up examination of the thyroid is not routinely performed. Here we describe a patient who was found to have a solitary metastasis of sigmoid cancer to the thyroid on postoperative imaging and has had prolonged disease-free survival after thyroidectomy. Our experience suggests that a low threshold of suspicion is crucial for timely diagnosis of thyroid metastasis from CRC and that resection can improve disease-free survival.";"2019";"Case reports in otolaryngology";NA

Seven tumor sites were defined as ascending, hepatic, cecum, transverse, descending, splenic, and sigmoid colons by the anatomical location. The associations of tumor site and LN status, including adequate (â‰¥12) LN harvest and LN positivity, were examined with logistic regression, adjusting for multiple covariates. Relative survival was compared in a flexible parametric model. <b>Results</b> The quartile number of LN examined gradually decreased from ascending to sigmoid colon cancer (P&lt;0.001 for all patients, and T2, T3 and T4 stages). More numbers of LN examined and a higher proportion of LN positivity were retrieved in left-half colon cancer than in right-half colon cancer.

Patients' population of the two arms was homogeneous as concerns demographic characteristics and stage of the disease. In arm A, resections were performed more frequently by mini-invasive approach as compared to arm B. Operative time was statistically longer in arm B. Postoperative complications rate was extremely low and comparable in both arms (13.4 and 8.0 in arms A and B, respectively). No postoperative mortality was observed. Overall 5-year survival rates were similar in arm A and B (82.3% and 73.05%, respectively; P=0.29). Arm B patients were treated either with more limited resections (resection of the TC and of the SF) or with extended colectomies (right- and left-sided, standard or enlarged, hemicolectomies), both associated with central vascular ligation. Despite a shorter length of surgical specimen after limited resections, postoperative complications, lymph node yield, and survival were absolutely comparable in both types of surgical treatments. Limited resections for TC and SF cancers can be performed with the same clinical, oncological and survival outcomes as compared to more extended colectomies if an adequate size of the specimen for the achievement of at least 5 cm of health margin is associated to Central Vascular Ligation.";"2019";"Minerva chirurgica";"Aged; Colectomy; Colon, Ascending; Colon, Sigmoid; Colon, Transverse; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Ligation; Male; Margins of Excision; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Time Factors"

A separate stenotic tumor was identified at the sigmoid colon, causing moderate dilatation of the whole intestine. An enterectomy, including the perforation site and the proximal six tumors, was performed, followed by limited enterectomies for the distal two tumors and side-to-side anastomoses of the small intestine. All resected tumors were identified at histology as metastatic from lung carcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient remained in a severe septic condition and succumbed the following day.

Surgery started through the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) with systematic medial mobilization (MM) has some theoretical advantages that have never been analyzed in a clinical trial. The aim of this study was to compare the two techniques with regards to surgical technique variables (conversion, surgical time, bleeding, morbidity, and mortality) and pathological outcomes. A single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of patients operated electively by laparoscopic with curative intention for rectal or sigmoid cancer was performed at a single, specialized colorectal surgery department from April 2016 to October 2017. 49 patients were included in each group. There were no statistical differences in patient demographics between the two approaches. Pathological outcomes did not differ between the two groups. Intra-operative characteristics showed a higher conversion rate in patients in which the inferior mesenteric artery was dissected first (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031). The artery approach also increased intra-operative bleeding (pâ€‰=â€‰0.049), but there were no differences regarding operative time. On multivariate analysis, the artery approach was associated with a higher risk of conversion (OR 8.68; pâ€‰=â€‰0.050). Post-operatory complications did not differ between artery and vein dissection. In our study, the initial approach by the IMV with a systematic MM of the splenic flexure has allowed us to reduce the conversion rate without increasing complications or the surgical time. No differences were observed in the pathological results. Both approaches seem to be safe and effective and well-trained laparoscopic surgeons should have the two techniques available to them for use as needed.";"2019";"Surgical endoscopy";"Colorectal cancer; Inferior mesenteric vein; Rectal cancer; Splenic colon flexure; Vascular approach"

Adenocarcinoma with mucinous features accounts for 10-15% of colon carcinoma. Distal nodal metastatic colorectal cancer is uncommon, and metastasis of colorectal cancer to the left supraclavicular lymph node is extremely rare without signs of metastatic organ involvement. We present a case of a 54-year-old Caucasian male with colonic adenocarcinoma that presented initially as a left-sided neck mass that had progressively increased in size over 9 months. On physical exam, a left supraclavicular soft tissue mass 6 cm in diameter was appreciated, it was non-tender with no submandibular lymphadenopathy. Soft tissue mass was palpable on the anterior abdominal wall in the epigastric region. Open excisional tissue biopsy of the left supraclavicular mass revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma with mucinous features and colonoscopy revealed a 6 cm obstructing mass in the transverse colon with biopsy revealing primary adenocarcinoma of the mucinous type. Palliative care with comfort measures was agreed upon. Typically, the most common sites of colon cancer metastasis are regional lymph nodes, liver, lung, bone and brain, and ours demonstrated an extremely rare pattern of colon cancer metastasis. The presentation to metastasize to the left supraclavicular node without solid end organ involvement makes this case even more novel.";"2019";"International journal of general medicine";"Virchowâ€™s node; adenocarcinoma with mucinous features from the colon; case report; colon cancer; skip micrometastases"

We evaluated the effect of regorafenib based on KRAS mutation status and the sidedness of the primary tumor in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We analyzed 135 patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) being treated with regorafenib at Samsung Medical Center, between January 2014 and January 2018. Primary tumors originating in the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, or proximal third of the transverse colon were defined as left-sided CRC (LC). Primary tumors originating in the appendix, cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, or distal two-thirds of the transverse colon were defined as right-sided CRC (RC). Among all 135 patients, 100 (74.1%) had left sided colon cancer and 35 (25.9%) had right-sided colon cancer. No patients achieved a complete response, but four achieved a partial response, revealing a response rate (RR) of 3.0%. Thirty-seven patients had stable disease, yielding a disease control rate (DCR) of 30.4%. There was no difference in RR or DCR according to the location of the primary tumor (LC vs. RC). A significant difference in progression free survival (PFS) with regorafenib was observed between the LC and RC groups (2.6 months; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.1 vs. 1.9 months; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.3; <i>P</i> = 0.04, respectively).

Earlier studies have indicated a short time interval between CRC diagnosis and distant metastases to be associated with poor prognosis. The majority of studies assessed outcome from CRC diagnosis or metastasis resection rather than from metastasis diagnosis and might be subject to immortal time bias. Patients in the population-based DACHS study were stratified: metastases at/within 1 month (immediate), 2 to 6 months (early), 7 to 12 months (intermediate), and &gt;12 months (late) after CRC diagnosis. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) from metastasis diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). HRs were adjusted for important confounders and immortal time. A total of 1027 patients were included. T4 (P &lt; 0.0001) and node-positive tumors (P &lt; 0.0001) were more frequent in the immediate group. Lung metastases (P &lt; 0.0001) and single-site metastases (P &lt; 0.0001) were more prevalent in the late group. In multivariable analysis, immediate metastases were not associated with poor OS compared to metastases at later time points (late vs immediate: HR 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.48). Subgroup analyses revealed poor OS of late versus immediate metastases for females (1.45; 1.08-1.96), proximal colon cancer (1.54; 1.09-2.16), and N0 (1.46; 1.00-2.12) or N1 disease (1.88; 1.17-3.05).

Patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for elective curative surgery with a primary anastomosis were eligible. Oral colistin, tobramycin and amphotericin B were administered to patients in the SDD group to decontaminate the digestive tract. Both treatment and control group received intravenous cefazolin and metronidazole for perioperative prophylaxis. Mechanical bowel preparation was given for left-sided colectomies, sigmoid and anterior resections. Anastomotic leakage was the primary outcome; infectious complications and mortality were secondary outcomes. The outcomes for 228 patients randomized to the SDD group and 227 randomized to the control group were analysed. The trial was stopped after interim analysis demonstrated that superiority was no longer attainable. Effective SDD was confirmed by interspace DNA profiling analysis of rectal swabs. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 14 patients (6Â·1 per cent) in the SDD group and in 22 patients (9Â·7 per cent) in the control group (odds ratio (OR) 0Â·61, 95 per cent c.i. 0Â·30 to 1Â·22).

The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of poor condition after surgery. He died 3 months after discharge without receiving any other treatment. It is worth thinking about whether surgery was reasonable for elderly patients with double malignancies, or palliative treatment to improve the quality of life was more meaningful.

Positive EGFR expression had an inverse correlation with PFS (2.5 vs. 14.0â€¯months, Pâ€¯=â€¯.039) and OS (9.6 vs. 19.7â€¯months, Pâ€¯=â€¯.044).

Regorafenib and FOLFIRI concomitant therapy with dose-escalated irinotecan seemed to be potentially practicable with satisfactory oncological results. KRAS mutations and EGFR expression might be predictors of poor oncological outcomes; however, left-sided mCRCs would be more beneficial for concomitant regorafenib and FOLFIRI therapy.";"2019";"Translational oncology";NA

Survival curve was drawn by Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression model. <b>Results:</b> The ratio of male patients with colon and rectal NEN was similar to female (<i>P</i>=0.095). Rectal NEN patients were younger (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), more highly differentiated (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and with earlier stage (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Survival analysis showed that the survival of rectal NEN was superior to that of colon NEN, with 10-year tumor-specific survival rates of 86.8% and 44.8% respectively (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that age, gender, marital status, primary tumor site, grade, stage and surgery were independent prognostic factors of colorectal NEN (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The most important factor was stage (<i>HR</i>=3.531), followed by differentiation grade (<i>HR</i>=1.856).

A retrospective cohort study using data from the SEER program (2007-2015). Of the 163,980 patients with CC, 85,779 (52.3%) presented with right-sided CC (RCC) and 78,201 (47.7%) with left-sided CC (LCC).

Overall survival of patients with colorectal cancer was analyzed by sidedness (right vs. left) and location (right vs. left vs. rectum). Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze all demographic and cancer variables available within the dataset to trace survival over a 35-year period. Subgroups within variables were compared to each other using log-rank test and considered significantly different at <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess impact of tumor location while controlling for age, year of diagnosis, sex, tumor stage, and tumor grade. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the independent effect of cancer location on overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, year of diagnosis, and cancer stage. To further explore the potential interaction effect of cancer location with cancer stage and year of diagnosis, similar multivariable Cox model was fit stratified by cancer stage (1-3 vs. 4) and by year of diagnosis (&lt;1980, 1980-2000, &gt;2000). <b>Results:</b> Overall survival differed significantly within all variables studied after Kaplan-Meier method analysis (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). Survival was higher in the left-side group when evaluated by tumor sidedness, and rectal cancer patients had the highest median survival (101.3 months). Right-sided cancer patients had the worst prognosis in both tumor location and sidedness analyses, with a median survival of 76.6 months. However, the stratified analysis showed that, the difference in survival between left- and right-sided cancer only existed in late cancer stage (stage 4) patients but not in early cancer stage; therefore, screening for CRC to pick cancer at an early stage can influence overall survival significantly. <b>Conclusion:</b> These observations confirm some of the previous and recent studies on sidedness of colorectal cancer patients. Our analysis is novel in that it included patients of all stages rather than just stage IV metastatic patients. This initial study provides a platform to investigate more biologic and clinical factors associated with tumor location. Merging this dataset with other available datasets and previously conducted studies within the institution will provide a robust platform for multiple future studies and collaborations. Finally, appropriate screening can result in a decrease in incidence and mortality of CRC.";"2019";"Frontiers in oncology";"colorectal cancer; survival; tumor heterogeneity; tumor location; tumor sidedness"

Metastasis to the liver is a leading cause of mortality in these patients. In human liver, metastatic cancer cells must evade populations of liver-resident natural killer (NK) cells with potent cytotoxic capabilities. Here, we investigated how these tumors evade liver NK-cell surveillance. Tissue biopsies were obtained from patients undergoing resection of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM, <i>n</i> = 18), from the tumor, adjacent tissue, and distal resection margin. The number and phenotype of liver-resident NK cells, at each site, were analyzed by flow cytometry. Tumor-conditioned media (TCM) was generated for cytokine and metabolite quantification and used to treat healthy liver-resident NK cells, isolated from donor liver perfusate during transplantation. Liver-resident NK cells were significantly depleted from CRLM tumors. Healthy liver-resident NK cells exposed to TCM underwent apoptosis <i>in vitro</i>, associated with elevated lactate. Tumor-infiltrating liver-resident NK cells showed signs of mitochondrial stress, which was recapitulated <i>in vitro</i> by treating liver-resident NK cells with lactic acid. Lactic acid induced apoptosis by decreasing the intracellular pH of NK cells, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction that could be prevented by blocking mitochondrial ROS accumulation. CRLM tumors produced lactate, thus decreasing the pH of the tumor microenvironment. Liver-resident NK cells migrating toward the tumor were unable to regulate intracellular pH resulting in mitochondrial stress and apoptosis. Targeting CRLM metabolism provides a promising therapeutic approach to restoring local NK-cell activity and preventing tumor growth.";"2019";"Cancer immunology research";NA

Clinical data also indicate that they respond differently to anti-EGFR therapies. The role of EGFR protein expression in KRAS wild type colorectal cancer is also controversial. Here we have used a cohort of anti-EGFR antibody treated KRAS-wild type colorectal cancer patients (nâ€‰=â€‰97) to analyse the prognostic role of EGFR protein expression in relation to sidedness. In our cohort EGFR copy number, determined by FISH, was not associated with the level of EGFR protein, assessed by immunohistochemistry and measured by H-scoring. There was a significantly higher EGFR H-score detected in RSCRC as compared to LSCRC in primary tumors (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). Furthermore, in a proportion of cases (nâ€‰=â€‰31) metastatic tissues were also available and their analysis also found a significantly higher EGFR H-score in metastases of RSCRC compared to LSCRC (pâ€‰=â€‰0.018). Kaplan Meyer survival analysis demonstrated that anti-EGFR antibody therapies were more effective in case of LSCRC compared to RSCRC. Although in case of progression-free survival data just indicated a trend (pâ€‰=â€‰0.065), in case of overall survival the difference was significant favouring LSCRC (pâ€‰=â€‰0.047). These data demonstrated for the first time that the EGFR protein expression is significantly higher in KRAS wild type RSLCL as compared to LSCRC. Meanwhile it is somewhat unexpected that the lower EGFR protein expression was found to be associated with better efficacy of anti-EGFR antibody therapies of colorectal cancer, the finding of which must be further validated.";"2019";"Pathology oncology research : POR";"Anti-EGFR therapy; Colon cancer; EGFR protein; Sidedness"

A retrospective single Center study.";"In recent years, with population aging, there has been an increased number of colorectal cancer cases with severe occlusion symptoms. About 75% of obstructions due to malignant colorectal cancer (10-30%) occur distal to splenic flexure. The authors evaluated the best surgical therapeutic strategy to be used in cases of left-sided colorectal carcinoma in patients over 65 years old, especially considering the emergency condition, age of patients and efficacy in terms of postoperative morbidity, mortality and 5 years survival rate. The management of left-sided obstructing colorectal carcinoma is controversial. Hartmann's procedure is the best therapeutic choice in elderly patients. However, resection with intraoperative colonic wash-out and primary anastomosis has favorable outcome in low risk patients. A review of the literature reveals that primary resection and anastomosis for left-sided obstructing CRC is the correct therapeutic strategy in low risk patients with localized, resectable carcinoma, without peritonitis; Hartmann's procedure should be adopted in doubtful cases and in high risk patients. Negli ultimi anni, con lâ€™invecchiamento della popolazione, câ€™Ã¨ stato un aumento del numero di casi di tumotumore del colon-retto con sintomi gravi di occlusione. Circa il 75% delle ostruzioni dovute a tumore maligno del colon-retto (10-30%) si verificano distalmente alla flessura splenica. Gli autori hanno valutato la migliore strategia a chirurgica terapeutica da utilizzare nei casi di carcinoma colo-rettale sinistro in pazienti di etÃ superiore a 65 anni, soprattutto considerando la condizione di emergenza, lâ€™etÃ dei pazienti e lâ€™efficacia in termini di morbilitÃ postoperatoria, mortalitÃ e sopravvivenza a 5 anni di vita. La gestione del carcinoma colo-rettale ostruttivo del lato sinistro Ã¨ controversa. La procedura di Hartmann Ã¨ la migliore scelta terapeutica nei pazienti anziani.

We investigated whether the prognostic values of sidedness and histology differed according to each other. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We analyzed 81342 patients with stage II-IV colon cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004 and 2012. Patients were divided into four subgroups on the basis of sidedness and histology: non-mucinous right-sided, non-mucinous left-sided, mucinous right-sided, and mucinous left-sided subgroups. Among each tumor stage, median overall survival (mOS) was compared between these subgroups after inverse probability propensity score weighting to handle confounding factors. <b>Results:</b> In the stage IV subgroup, the prognosis for non-mucinous left-sided tumors (weighted mOS, 24.5 months) was significantly better than that for non-mucinous right-sided tumors (weighted mOS, 16.5 months; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and that for mucinous left-sided tumors (weighted mOS, 16.5 months; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), whereas the survival was similar between left-sided and right-sided tumors with the mucinous subtype (weighted mOS, 16.5 months for both; <i>P</i>=0.570; test for interaction between sidedness and histology, <i>P<sub>interaction</sub></i> &lt;0.001), and between mucinous and non-mucinous tumors in the right-sided colon (weighted mOS, 16.5 months for both; <i>P</i>=0.207).

The characteristics of perforation differ based on the site of perforation, presenting as either perforation at the cancer site or perforation proximal to the cancer site. Peritonitis due to perforation tends to be more severe in cases of perforation proximal to the cancer site; however, the difference in the outcome between the two types remains unclear. Surgical treatment of colon cancer with perforation has changed over time. Recently, many reports have shown the safety and effectiveness of single-stage operation consisting of resection and primary anastomosis with intraoperative colonic lavage. Under certain conditions, laparoscopic surgery can be feasible and help minimize the invasion. However, emergent surgery for colon cancer with perforation is associated with a high rate of mortality and morbidity. The long-term prognosis seems to have no association with the existence of perforation. Oncologically curative resection may be warranted for perforated colon cancer.

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic viability of targeting the mediator kinase CDK8, an early clinical stage drug target, as a means to suppress metastasis of colon cancer. CDK8 was amplified or overexpressed in many colon cancers and CDK8 expression correlated with shorter patient survival. Knockdown or inhibition of CDK8 had little effect on colon cancer cell growth but suppressed metastatic growth of mouse and human colon cancer cells in the liver. This effect was due in part to inhibition of already established hepatic metastases, indicating therapeutic potential of CDK8 inhibitors in the metastatic setting. In contrast, knockdown or inhibition of CDK8 had no significant effect on the growth of tumors implanted subcutaneously, intrasplenically, or orthotopically in the cecum. CDK8 mediated colon cancer growth in the liver through downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor TIMP3 via TGFÎ²/SMAD-driven expression of a TIMP3-targeting microRNA, miR-181b, along with induction of Mmp3 in murine or MMP9 in human colon cancer cells via Wnt/Î²-catenin-driven transcription. These findings reveal a new mechanism for negative regulation of gene expression by CDK8 and a site-specific role for CDK8 in colon cancer hepatic metastasis. Our results indicate the utility of CDK8 inhibitors for the treatment of colon cancer metastases in the liver and suggest that CDK8 inhibitors may be considered in other therapeutic settings involving TGFÎ²/SMAD or Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activation. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that inhibition of the transcription-regulating kinase CDK8 exerts a site-specific tumor-suppressive effect on colon cancer growth in the liver, representing a unique therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of advanced colon cancer.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/23/6594/F1.large.jpg.";"2019";"Cancer research";"Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Matrix Metalloproteinases; Mice; MicroRNAs; RNA Interference; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3; Treatment Outcome; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"

This causes concerns about interval cancers, which have been proposed to progress more rapidly. We compared outcomes of patients with interval CRCs after sigmoidoscopy screening vs outcomes of patients with CRC who had not been screened. We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized sigmoidoscopy screening trial in Norway with 98,684 participants (age range, 50-64 years) who were randomly assigned to groups that were (nÂ = 20,552) or were not (nÂ = 78,126) invited for sigmoidoscopy screening from 1999 through 2001; participants were followed up for a median 14.8 years. We compared CRC mortality and all-cause mortality between individuals who underwent screening and were diagnosed with CRC 30 days or longer after screening (interval cancer group, nÂ = 163) and individuals diagnosed with CRC in the nonscreened group (controls, nÂ = 1740). All CRCs in the control group were identified when they developed symptoms (clinically detected CRCs). Analyses were stratified by cancer site. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratio (HRs), adjusted for age and sex.

Tumor sidedness has also been implicated in resistance to these therapies, but has largely been studied in the first-line setting. We examined the role of tumor sidedness and disease bulk in predicting clinical outcomes to anti-EGFR therapy in the treatment-refractory setting. <b>Methods:</b> We identified a retrospective cohort of 62 patients with <i>KRAS</i> wild-type mCRC who received anti-EGFR therapy in the late-line setting. Response was assessed per RECIST 1.1, with bulky disease defined as any single lesion &gt;35 mm in longest cross-sectional diameter or nodal short axis. Primary sidedness was defined in relation to the splenic flexure. <b>Results:</b> Patients with right-sided primary tumors at time of late-line EGFR therapy presented with increased tumor bulk and worsened overall survival (OS) relative to left-sided primary tumors. Tumor bulk, defined as either a categorical or continuous variable, predicted worsened progression-free survival (PFS) and OS, which persisted when controlling for differences in the primary tumor location. Within the right-sided cohort, no objective responses were observed for bulky disease or during treatment with anti-EGFR monotherapy. The nonbulky cohort experienced clinical benefit with anti-EGFR monotherapy, showing similar PFS and an improved response rate compared with sequential chemotherapy. <b>Conclusions:</b> In an effort to expand understanding of the role of primary sidedness in clinical response to anti-EGFR therapy, we identified sidedness and tumor bulk as potential predictive biomarkers of clinical response in late-line mCRC. Future prospective studies of EGFR targeting should consider tumor bulk in addition to molecular profiling in the identification of populations most likely to achieve meaningful clinical benefit.";"2019";"Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN";"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Cetuximab; Colorectal Neoplasms; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; ErbB Receptors; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Panitumumab; Prognosis; Progression-Free Survival; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; Retrospective Studies"

Our study included 77 patients with mCRC (13/63, right/left) with <i>KRAS</i> exon 2 wild-type tumors from phase II trials of first-line therapy with cetuximab. Expression levels of 2,551 genes were measured in tissue samples by HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel.

In addition, a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify significant gene pathways in each sidedness. Sixty-nine patients were assessable for gene expression data. Overexpression of <i>BECN1</i> [log<sub>2</sub>(CPM) â‰¥ 6.8] was associated with favorable survival, regardless of tumor sidedness. High expression of <i>NOTCH1</i> [log<sub>2</sub>(CPM) â‰¥ 7.5] predicted significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS; median 14.7 vs. 11.1 months, HR 0.43, <i>P</i> = 0.01) and overall survival (OS; median 42.8 vs. 26.5 months, HR 0.35, <i>P</i> = 0.01) in left side but not in right side. The GSEA showed that regulation of DNA replication gene set correlated with favorable survival in the left, whereas the subcellular component and leukocyte migration gene sets were associated with good survival in the right.

It may present with distant metastasis; however, metastasis to the testes is very rare and signifies an advanced stage of the disease. Surgery is the only effective modality to cure patients with localized colorectal carcinomas. However, statistics show a higher incidence of unresectable disease and a higher metastasis rate in childhood colorectal carcinomas. We present a case of advanced colorectal carcinoma with testicular metastasis in an adolescent. A 15-year-old Indian Hindu boy presented to surgical emergency with signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction. He also had a history of passing blood and mucus per rectum. On examination he had abdominal distension. On digital rectal examination, a circumferential proliferative growth was felt 1Â cm above the anal verge. On scrotal examination, a small nodule was felt in his right testis. In view of intestinal obstruction, he was taken into our emergency operation theater and a diverting loop sigmoid colostomy was performed to relieve the obstruction. A punch biopsy from anorectal growth was taken which suggested signet ring cell adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed advanced colorectal carcinoma with distant metastasis. Ultrasonography of his testes showed a hypoechoic nodule in the right testis from which a needle aspiration biopsy was done which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma. Childhood colorectal carcinomas have a very poor prognosis due to their aggressive nature and late presentation. In spite of all the advances in diagnosis and treatments, the overall long-term survival is still dismal in these patients. Due to the rarity of this disease, screening is not recommended for individuals under the age of 50. Thus, to improve outcome, early diagnosis and treatment is paramount.

Here, we have analyzed ALDH1A1 mRNA and protein levels in relation to clinical, histopathological and molecular tumor features in large series of human colorectal cancer. ALDH1A1 protein levels were determined by immunohistochemistry in a series of primary colorectal tumors and their corresponding liver metastases (n = 158). ALDH1A1 mRNA levels were analyzed in several large patient cohorts of colorectal cancer. ALDH1A1 mRNA and protein levels were then related to overall survival and to clinical, histopathological and molecular tumor features. High levels of ALDH1A1 were associated with a poorly differentiated histology and a right-sided tumor location, but not to a mesenchymal-like molecular subtype. Liver metastases contained significantly higher levels of ALDH1A1 compared to the corresponding primary tumors. Radio- and/or chemotherapy prior to tumor resection was associated with increased ALDH1A1 levels regardless of the molecular subtype. Finally, ALDH1A1 protein expression in primary tumors and metastases correlated with shorter overall survival. ALDH1A1 expression is associated with features of poor prognosis, including a poorly differentiated histology and 'right-sidedness' of the primary tumor, and with shorter overall survival. ALDH1A1 is also highly expressed in therapy-surviving tumors and in liver metastases.

This is a retrospective national cohort study, including all patients operated on for ORCC from 2000 to 2015. Those treated with colonic stent or symptomatic treatment were excluded. We described outcomes after surgery for ORCC and performed multivariate analyses for mortality, morbidity and survival. Among 776 patients analyzed, 716 (92%) had their primary tumor removed, with primary anastomosis in 582 (82%). The remaining 194 underwent anastomosis with loop ileostomy (nÂ =Â 21), resection with double-end stoma (nÂ =Â 113), defunctioning stoma without resection (nÂ =Â 48) and ileocolic by-pass (nÂ =Â 12). Postoperative mortality, morbidity and anastomotic leak rates were 10%, 51% and 14%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age &gt;70, ASA score â‰¥3 and hemodynamic instability were predictors of postoperative mortality whereas ASA score â‰¥3, hemodynamic instability and intra-operative complications were predictors of severe morbidity. No factors were correlated with anastomotic leak. After a median follow-up of 26 months, 8% of patients were alive with a permanent stoma. Five-year overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival was 42%, 42% and 62%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, peritonitis, synchronous metastases and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy were predictors of decreased overall survival. Emergency surgery for ORCC is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Two third of patients with ORCC can be managed with resection and primary anastomosis.

With some literature consideration, we report that ovarian metastasis triggered the diagnosis of unresectable advanced gastric cancer with long-term survival through multidisciplinary treatment. This is the case of a 69-year-old woman, who was diagnosed with ovarian tumor and underwent right extracorporectomy and omentum resection in 2011. Pathological diagnosis suspected adenocarcinoma. In February 2012, EGD found a type 4 tumor in the upper portion of the pyloric area of the stomach. She was diagnosed with gastric cancer with Stage IV(T4aN0M1 [ovary])ovarian metastasis. Because the primary tumor was HER2 positive, XP plus HER therapy(capecitabine 1,000mg/m2 twice a day for 14 days, CDDP 80mg/m2 every 3 weeks on the first day, and trastuzumab 8 mg/kg every 3 weeks on the first day)was administered since March 2012. No metastasis was found in the imaging examination after 8 courses of chemotherapy, and we also confirmed the reduction of the primary tumor in the EGD. Based on the images, primary resection was already possible. In December 2012, after a diagnostic laparoscopy, total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was performed. Postoperative pathology was diagnosed as Stage IV(pT4aN0M1). To control postoperative micrometastasis, capecitabine therapy(1,000mg/m2 twice a day for 14 days)was administered for 12 months starting from February 2013. Then, recurrence and metastasis were not observed during follow-up. However, in January 2017, a circumstellar stenotic tumor was found in the rectum and was diagnosed as recurrence of peritoneal dissemination through images. In February 2017, artificial ostomy(in the sigmoid colon, double-mouth type)was made. Then, the patient underwent an outpatient chemotherapy, with hospital visits, and she survives.";"2019";"Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Differences in prognosis remain even among patients with metastatic disease, indicating that anatomy or stage at diagnosis alone cannot explain all of these findings. While genetic differences between right- and left-sided CRC have long been described, the genetic and molecular drivers underlying differences in prognosis and treatment response remain incompletely understood. We compared mutation prevalence between right- (cecum to splenic flexure) and left-sided (descending colon to rectum) CRC among 38 genes in a retrospective review of next-generation sequencing data of CRC samples obtained in routine clinical practice at a single academic medical center. Among 288 cases (167 left-sided, 103 right-sided, 18 synchronous or without clear primary), patients with left-sided primaries had a longer overall survival from pathologic diagnosis (median 1,823 days <i>vs.</i> 1,006 days for right-sided cases, P=0.004). Among the assessed genes, <i>BRAF</i> and <i>CTNNB1</i> mutations were more prevalent in right-sided CRC. <i>BRAF</i> was mutated in 15.5% of right-sided CRC (95% CI: 8.5-22.5%) compared to 4.8% (95% CI: 1.6-8.0%) (P=0.003). <i>CTNNB1</i> was mutated in 3.9% of right-sided CRC (95% CI: 0.2-7.6%) compared to no instances of <i>CTNNB1</i> mutations in left-sided disease (P=0.01).

However, the currently available data for early-stage disease are limited and inconsistent. We explored the clinicopathologic, treatment, and outcome data from a multisite Australian CRC registry from 2003 to 2016. Tumors at and distal to the splenic flexure were considered a left primary (LP). For the 6547 patients identified, the median age at diagnosis was 69 years, 55% were men, and most (63%) had a LP. Comparing the outcomes for right primary (RP) versus LP, time-to-recurrence was similar for stage I and III disease, but longer for those with a stage II RP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.90; PÂ &lt; .01). Adjuvant chemotherapy provided a consistent benefit in stage III disease, regardless of the tumor side. Overall survival (OS) was similar for those with stage I and II disease between LP and RP patients; however, those with stage III RP disease had poorer OS (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62; PÂ &lt; .05) and cancer-specific survival (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.19-2.03; PÂ &lt; .01).

In early-stage CRC, the association of tumor side and effect on the time-to-recurrence and OS varies by stage. In stage III patients with an RP, poorer OS and cancer-specific survival outcomes are, in part, driven by inferior survival after recurrence, and tumor side did not influence adjuvant chemotherapy benefit.";"2019";"Clinical colorectal cancer";"CSS; Clinicopathologic predictors; Colon cancer; OS; Tumor location; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Australia; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Prevalence; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Registries; Survival Analysis"

However, colorectal cancer is not a single type of tumor; its pathogenesis depends on the anatomical location of the tumor and differs between right side and left side of the colon. Tumors in the proximal colon (right side) and distal colon (left side) exhibit different molecular characteristics and histology. In the right-sided tumors, mutations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway are commonly observed; and these tumors generally have a flat histology. In the left-sided tumors, chromosomal instability pathway-related mutations, such as <i>KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, p53</i> mutations are observed and these tumors demonstrate polypoid-like morphology. Therapy responses are totally different between these tumor entities. Left-sided colorectal cancer (LCRC) patients benefit more from adjuvant chemotherapies such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based regimes, and targeted therapies such as anti- epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy, and have a better prognosis. Right-sided colorectal cancer (RCRC) patients do not respond well to conventional chemotherapies, but demonstrate more promising results with immunotherapies because these tumors have high antigenic load. For the development of effective therapy regimes and better treatment options, it is essential to evaluate right-sided and left-sided tumors as separate entities, and design the therapy regime considering the differences between these tumors.";"2019";"Gastroenterology research";"Adjuvant chemotherapies; Colorectal cancer; Epidemiology; Immunotherapies; Left side; Molecular mechanism; Right side; Targeted therapies"

We categorized primary tumor site as located proximal (right) or distal (left) to the splenic flexure. The associations between PTL (right- vs left-sided) and disease-free survival (DFS), survival after relapse (SAR), and overall survival (OS) were assessed by Cox models and adjusted for clinical and pathological features, treatment, and MSI, BRAF, and RAS status. Among the 1869 patients (1056 [57%] male; mean [SD] age, 59.4 [9.5] years) with full molecular data analyzed, 755 (40%) had a right-sided tumor, 164 (10%) had MSI, 942 (50%) had RAS mutations, and 212 (11%) had BRAF mutations.

While left segmental colectomy is an accepted and oncologically safe practice for left-sided colonic cancer (CC), some authors suggest that limited segmental resection of right-sided cancer should be debated in order to preserve length of the resected colon. To our knowledge, caecum and ascending CC have not been analysed as different groups of tumours. The objective of this study was to assess if, retrospectively, surgical treatment of caecal cancer differed from ascending CC. A review of all consecutive patients with right colonic resection for cancer admitted to the University hospital of Grenoble from January 2005 to August 2016 was performed. Length of resected colon was compared between caecal primary and ascending CC. Other technical and pathological aspects were analysed such as minimal invasive surgery and number of harvested lymph nodes from anatomic specimens. Among operated patients, tumour was localized pre-operatively on caecum in 110 cases and on the right ascending colon in 119 cases. Pre-operative localization had no effect on resected colon length (mean 24.5â€‰cm, 24â€‰Â±â€‰10.34 versus 25â€‰cmâ€‰Â±â€‰7.28, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.95), on the number of harvested lymph nodes with a mean of 15 (Â±7.6) nodes in the caecal group versus 15.2 (Â±7.3) (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.72).

An updated meta-analysis was undertaken to explore more convinced comparative findings between SILRC and CLRC. The search for studies that compared SILRC with CLRC was done on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library.

We consecutively selected 575 colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection from 2008 to 2011. RCC was located from the cecum to the transverse colon, and LCRC was located from the splenic flexure to the rectum. Frequencies of KRAS gene mutation, BRAF gene mutation, microsatellite instability (MSI), l18qLOH and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) were statistically analyzed between groups. Tumors were located in the RCC in 26.3% of patients and in the LCRC in 73.7%. Elderly patients, females and advanced diseases were significantly more frequent in the RCC group than in the LCRC group. However, venous invasion was significantly more frequent in LCRC than in RCC. Between groups, BRAF mutant type, KRAS mutant type, MSI and CIMP+ were significantly more frequent in RCC, whereas 18qLOH was significantly more frequent in LCRC. In overall survival, RCC demonstrated poor prognosis compared with LCRC; however, age, gender, stage, lymphatic invasion, KRAS status and BRAF status rather than tumor location were independent prognostic factors. In addition, the independent prognostic factors in RCC were different from those in LCRC in each stage. However, the consistency between OS and DFS was not observed in this study, excluding lymphatic invasion in LCRC. Comparing RCC with LCRC, RCC is different from LCRC in clinicopathological features, molecular biomarkers and prognostic factors in Japanese colorectal cancer patients.

This study aimed to determine the effect of tumor sidedness in survival in early stage and relapsed colon cancer. Patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer were identified from the BC Cancer Agency Gastrointestinal Cancer Outcomes Unit. Survival analysis by stage and sidedness was compared with the log-rank test. Baseline characteristics were controlled by multivariate Cox-proportional hazard models. In relapsed patients, bevacizumab and EGFR inhibitor (EGFRI) treatments were included and tested for interaction. Among 5378 patients with stage I-III colon cancer, patients with right-sided stage II tumors experienced better relapse-free survival compared with those with left-sided tumors; right-sidedness was not prognostic for RFS in stage III disease. When survival was considered in patients who relapsed, right-sided tumors had inferior survival after relapse in both stage II and stage III tumors. At relapse, right-sided outcomes were inferior regardless of biologic therapy. An interaction test revealed a significant association between sidedness and survival with EGFRIs. In this large, population-based study, right-sided presentation has a significant prognostic impact: in early stage, right-sidedness is favorably prognostic among stage II tumors and not prognostic in stage III disease. After relapse, right- sidedness is associated with an inferior prognosis, regardless of initial stage of presentation. Colon tumor sidedness is independently prognostic and may be considered in treatment assignment for both early stage and advanced disease.";"2019";"Health science reports";"colon cancer; leftâ€sided; prognostic factors; rightâ€sided; stage"

In this study, immunohistochemical expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was analysed in tissue microarrays with primary tumours from 557 incident CRC cases from a prospective population-based cohort. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, TNM stage, differentiation grade and vascular invasion, were applied to determine the impact of biomarker expression on 5-year overall survival (OS), in the entire cohort and in subgroup analysis of right colon, left colon, and rectum. High PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells was an independent factor of a prolonged OS in the entire cohort (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] CI 0.35 - 0.68), and in tumours of the right colon (HR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.25 - 0.74) and the left colon (HR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.13 - 0.61), but not in rectal cancer.

The aim of this randomized trial was to clarify whether the inferior mesenteric artery should be tied at the origin (high tie) or distal to the left colic artery (low tie). Patients were allocated randomly to undergo either high- or low-tie ligation and were stratified by surgical approach (open or laparoscopic). The primary outcome was the incidence of anastomotic leakage. Secondary outcomes were duration of surgery, blood loss and 5-year overall survival. Some 331 patients entered the trial between June 2006 and September 2012. The trial was stopped prematurely as recruitment was slow. Seven patients were excluded after randomization but before operation because of procedural changes. High tie and low tie were performed in 164 and 160 patients respectively. The incidence of anastomotic leakage was not significantly different (17Â·7 versus 16Â·3 per cent respectively; P = 0Â·731). The incidence of severe complications requiring intervention was 2Â·4 versus 5Â·0 per cent for high and low tie respectively (P = 0Â·222). In multivariable analysis, risk factors for anastomotic leakage included male sex (odds ratio 4Â·36, 95 per cent c.i. 1Â·56 to 12Â·18) and distance of the tumour from the anal verge (odds ratio 0Â·99, 0Â·98 to 1Â·00).

The outcome was not affected by disease sidedness or rectal primary. Treatment was well tolerated without grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Trimodality therapy produces sustainable long-term survival in selected patients with metastatic CRC presenting with isolated retroperitoneal or mesenteric nodal relapse.

The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR, minimum 42 responses). We retrospectively assessed mutations in genes implicated in CRC with massively parallel sequencing; ERBB2 and EGFR amplification with fluorescence in situ hybridization, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte density. Among 78 patients enrolled, 45 (57.7%) completed 6 cycles. Most common grade 3-4 toxicities were skin rash (19.2%), diarrhea (18%), and neuropathy (6.4%).

Mutational profiling for &gt;150 mutations across commonly mutated cancer genes including RAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and PTEN as well as treatment data, including receipt of a biologic agent, were collected. Univariable/multivariable models were used to analyze relationships between collected data and OS. Among 367 patients, sidedness breakdown was as follows: 234 left (64%), 133 right (36%). 56% were male, with a median age at diagnosis of 57 (range 24-89). A total of 143 patients had RAS mutations.

The timing for reversal of Hartmann's is not well defined as it is technically challenging and carries a high complication rate. Methods This study is a retrospective audit of all patients who underwent Hartmann's procedure between 2008 and 2014. Reversal of Hartmann's rate, timing, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, length of stay and complications (Clavien-Dindo) including 30-day mortality were recorded. Results Hartmann's procedure (n = 228) indications were complicated diverticular disease 44% (n = 100), malignancy 32% (n = 74) and other causes 24%, (n = 56). Reversal of Hartmann's rate was 47% (n = 108). Median age of patients was 58 years (range 21-84 years), American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 2 (range 1-4), length of stay was eight days (range 2-42 days). Median time to reversal of Hartmann's was 11 months (range 4-96 months). The overall complication rate from reversal of Hartmann's was 21%; 3.7% had a major complication of IIIa or above including three anastomotic leaks and one deep wound dehiscence. Failure of reversal and permanent stoma was less than 1% (n = 2). Thirty-day mortality following Hartmann's procedure was 7% (n = 15). Where Hartmann's procedure wass not reversed, for 30% (n = 31) this was the patient's choice and 70% (n = 74) were either high risk or unfit. Conclusions Hartmann's procedure is reversed less frequently than thought and consented for. Only 46% of Hartmann's procedures were stoma free at the end of the audit period.

End-points evaluated included 5-year mortality, number of patients with retrieved positive metastatic lymph nodes (LN) at the root of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), number of retrieved LNs, morbidity, mortality, recurrence, bowel obstruction, intraoperative blood loss, anastomotic leakage, operation time, surgical site infection and postoperative bleed. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to analyze dichotomous data. Seventeen studies including 6247 patients were identified for the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that preserving the LCA was associated with reduced anastomotic leakage rate (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.98; Pâ€¯=â€¯0.03). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the 5-year mortality, number of retrieved LNs, number of patients with retrieved positive metastatic LNs at the root of IMA, morbidity, mortality, recurrence, bowel obstruction, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, surgical site infection and postoperative bleed. In comparison with ligating the left colic artery, preserving the left colic artery seems to achieve comparable success with acceptable safety outcomes and we suggest to preserve the LCA in the sigmoid and rectal cancer surgeries.

Particularly, the Consensus Panelists currently state that SEMS placement as a bridge to surgery is not recommended as the standard treatment because (1) it does not reduce the postoperative mortality in the general population, (2) SEMS may be associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence, and (3) acute resection is feasible in young and fit patients, with an acceptable postoperative mortality rate. A 32-year-old lady was admitted with complete LBO from obstructing sigmoid carcinoma. Initial i.v. CE-CT scan detected a large bowel partial obstruction with fecal impaction in the entire colon until sigmoid with some mildly dilated SB loops. The presence of a thickened area in the colonic wall could not be assessed because the patient was young and thin and in such patients the CT appearance of bowel wall cannot be clearly appreciated. She was initially managed with laxatives and gastrografin. The patient's obstruction did not improve and abdominal distension worsened with nausea and colicky pain. Urgent endoscopy detected a friable mass, consistent with completely obstructing carcinoma of the mid sigmoid. Biopsies were taken and distal ink marking was made. Whole-body urgent CT scan with i.v. contrast was performed in order to obtain full preoperative staging and to rule out distant metastases. CT scan and the previously given oral gastrografin confirmed complete large bowel obstruction with a tight stricture in the sigmoid.

We compared molecular alterations, histopathologic features, and disease-specific survival in a series of 328 colonic adenocarcinomas identified over a 2-year period and stratified by tumor location (cecum, right colon, and left colon). Overall, cecal adenocarcinomas demonstrated the highest frequency of molecular abnormalities with 74% harboring either a KRAS exon 2 or 3 mutation, a BRAF mutation, or DNA mismatch repair protein deficiency. KRAS mutations were more frequently seen in the cecum compared with all other tumor sites (P=0.03).

However, it is unclear if this division is optimal and whether precise tumor location provides further information.<b>Experimental Design:</b> In 1,876 patients with colorectal cancer, we compared mutation prevalence and overall survival (OS) according to side and location. Consensus molecular subtype (CMS) was compared in a separate cohort of 608 patients.<b>Results:</b> Mutation prevalence differed by side and location for <i>TP53, KRAS, BRAFV600, PIK3CA, SMAD4, CTNNB1, GNAS</i>, and <i>PTEN</i> Within left- and right-sided tumors, there remained substantial variations in mutation rates. For example, within right-sided tumors, <i>RAS</i> mutations decreased from 70% for cecal, to 43% for hepatic flexure location (<i>P</i> = 0.0001), while <i>BRAF</i>V600 mutations increased from 10% to 22% between the same locations (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). Within left-sided tumors, the sigmoid and rectal region had more <i>TP53</i> mutations (<i>P</i> = 0.027), less <i>PIK3CA</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.0009), <i>BRAF</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.0033), or <i>CTNNB1</i> mutations (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001), and less MSI (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) than other left-sided locations. Despite this, a left/right division preceding the transverse colon maximized prognostic differences by side and transverse colon tumors had K-modes mutation clustering that appeared more left than right sided. CMS profiles showed a decline in CMS1 and CMS3 and rise in CMS2 prevalence moving distally.<b>Conclusions:</b> Current right/left classifications may not fully recapitulate regional variations in tumor biology.

ESRD population are at increased risk of bleeding secondary to use of anticoagulation during hemodialysis and uremia induced platelet dysfunction. Gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for 3-7% of all deaths in ESRD population. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding refers to blood loss from a site in the gastrointestinal tract distal to the ligament of Treitz. It is usually suspected when a patient complains of hematochezia. It is different from patients presenting with hematemesis that suggests bleeding from upper gastrointestinal tract. Common causes of lower gastrointestinal bleed include diverticulosis, ischemia, hemorrhoids, neoplasia, angiodysplasia, and inflammatory bowel disease. ESRD patients are known to retain phosphate alone or in combination with calcium which has been associated with high mortality. Sevelamer is a phosphate binder used widely in ESRD population. The known side effects of sevelamer include metabolic acidosis, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence, fecal impaction, and skin rash.

The 3-year and 5-year survival rates of colorectal SMPC patients were 76.5% and 64.7%. Two-original carcinoma is the most common in colorectal SMPC patients, which mainly distributes in sigmoid colon and rectum. Postoperative monitoring should be strengthened for those patients with younger age, poor pathological types and advanced staging to prevent recurrence and metastasis.";"2018";"Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms, Multiple Primary; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies"

In particular, it is an issue in the Northern Hemisphere where UVB radiation does not penetrate the atmosphere as readily. There is a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that cancer of the ascending (right side) colon is different from cancer of the descending (left side) colon in terms of prognosis, tumor differentiation, and polyp type, as well as at the molecular level. Right-side tumors have elevated Wnt signaling and are more likely to relapse, whereas left-side tumors have reduced expression of tumor suppressor genes. This study seeks to understand both the proteomic and metabolomic changes resulting from treatment of the active metabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol, in right-sided and left-sided colon cancer. Our results show that left-sided colon cancer treated with calcitriol has a substantially greater number of changes in both the proteome and the metabolome than right-sided colon cancer. We found that calcitriol treatment in both right-sided and left-sided colon cancer causes a downregulation of ribosomal protein L37 and protein S100A10. Both of these proteins are heavily involved in tumorigenesis, suggesting a possible mechanism for the correlation between low vitamin D levels and colon cancer.";"2019";"Metabolites";"calcitriol; colon cancer; iTRAQ; metabolomics; proteomics; vitamin D"

With the aim to investigate clinical and molecular disease characteristics with respect to sidedness in a real-world cohort, we analyzed 161 mCRC patients included in the KRAS Registry of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft MedikamentÃ¶se Tumortherapie (AGMT) between January 2006 and October 2013. Right-sided mCRC displayed a worse median overall survival (OS) in comparison to left-sided disease (18.1Â months [95%-CI: 14.3-40.7] versus 32.3Â months [95%-CI: 25.5-38.6]; HR: 1.63 [95%-CI: 1.13-2.84]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.013). The choice of the biological agent in front-line therapy had a statistically significant impact on median OS in patients with right-sided tumours (anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR): 10.6Â months [95%-CI: 5.2-NA]; anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): 26.2Â months [95%-CI: 17.9-NA]; HR: 2.69 [95%-CI: 1.30-12.28]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.015) but not in patients with left-sided tumours (anti-EGFR: 37.0Â months [95%-CI: 20.2-56.6]; anti-VEGF: 32.3Â months [95%-CI: 23.6-41.1]; HR: 0.97 [95%-CI: 0.56-1.66]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.905). When evaluating molecular characteristics of tumour samples, we found a clinically meaningful trend towards an inferior OS in TP53 mutant mCRC treated with anti-EGFR based therapy compared to anti-VEGF based therapy (17.1Â months [95%-CI: 8.7-NA] versus 38.3Â months [95%-CI: 23.6-48.0], HRâ€‰=â€‰1.95 [95%-CI: 0.95-5.88]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.066), which was not significantly dependent on sidedness. This was not the case in patients with TP53 wild-type tumours. Therefore we evaluated the combined impact of sidedness and TP53 mutation status in the anti-EGFR treated cohort and patients with left-sided/TP53 wild-type mCRC showed the longest median OS (38.9Â months) of all groups (right-sided/TP53 mutant: 12.1Â months; right-sided/TP53 wild-type: 8.9Â months; left-sided/TP53 mutant: 18.4Â months; pâ€‰=â€‰0.020). TP53 mutation and right-sidedness are associated with shorter OS in patients treated with anti-EGFR based therapy but not with anti-VEGF based therapy.

However, the aggressive treatment of pelvic tumors with surgical resection and radiotherapy, along with liberal use of ureteral catheters, has been attributed to an increase in their incidence. Unless they are promptly diagnosed and treated, uretero-arterial fistulas are associated with considerably high rates of morbidity and mortality. Urologists need maintain a high degree of suspicion for uretero-arterial fistula in high-risk patients. We herein present the clinical course of an iliac artery-uretero-colonic fistula. <b> <i>Case Presentation:</i> </b> A 67-year-old woman with a history of colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic high anterior resection in July 2010. A ureteral stent inserted to right ureteral stricture, which developed as a result of local recurrence of the tumor in September 2010. She had undergone chemoradiotherapy, but the lesion had slowly increased in size. During the replacement of the ureteral stent in April 2016, she immediately experienced bladder tamponade, bloody bowel discharge, and hypotension. Contrast CT revealed a complex fistula between the right distal ureter and the right internal iliac artery. Furthermore, contrast medium flowed into the intestinal tract through the tumor. The patient was therefore diagnosed with internal iliac artery-uretero-colonic fistula. Arteriography revealed a right uretero-internal iliac artery fistula, and the embolization of the right internal iliac artery was performed. The right ureteral stent was removed. Her hematuria and bloody bowel discharge disappeared, but right nephrostomy was performed because she presented with acute pyelonephritis to ureteral obstruction. <b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> In the present case, the uretero-arterial fistula was caused by the long use of an indwelling stent, chemoradiotherapy, infection, and an increase in the size of the lesion. When a suspected uretero-arterial fistula is accompanied by bloody bowel discharge, we should consider the possibility of traffic to the intestinal tract.";"2019";"Journal of endourology case reports";"arterioenteric fistula; artery embolization; ureteral stricture; uretero-arterial fistula"

Leakage is one of the complications that increase mortality and morbidity in patients. The beneficial effects of a rectal tube in reducing anastomosis leak are controversial. Ileostomy as diverting stool may reduce risk of anastomosis leak. To evaluate the results of rectal tube application to reduce leakage in low pelvic anastomosis. In a prospective cohort study, 53 patients who were candidates for low anterior resection, extended low anterior resection, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, were enrolled in this study. After anastomosis, a large bore Foley was inserted transanally and put in the proximal of the anastomotic site, after fixation; we left it at least for 5 days then removed it if there was any sign of leakage.

RTCC was defined as a tumor located proximal to the splenic flexure. The characteristics of RTCC cancer were investigated by using descriptive analyses, and their impacts on the prognosis were assessed by using a Cox multivariate regression. Compared to LTCC, RTCC showed a female-dominant feature, and an undifferentiated pathology was more frequently observed. The number of lymph nodes retrieved from patients with RTCC was significantly higher than that retrieved from patients with LTCC. During 75 months of follow-up, peritoneal recurrence was more common in patients with RTCC than it was in patients with LTCC, and among the patients with stage III colon cancer, the disease-free and the overall survival rates were significantly worse in patients with RTCC.

Several uncommon genomic mechanisms of primary resistance, leading to activation of tyrosine kinase receptors other than EGFR or downstream signalling pathways, have been suggested by preclinical and retrospective studies. We conducted this multicentre, prospective, case-control study to demonstrate the negative predictive impact of a panel of rare genomic alterations [PRESSING (PRimary rESiStance IN RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with anti-eGfr monoclonal antibodies) panel], including HER2/MET amplifications, ALK/ROS1/NTRK1-3/RET fusions and PIK3CA mutations.

However, the literature on the prognostic value of tumor laterality is conflicting. To explore differences in laterality based on disease characteristics and outcomes in a population-based cohort of early-stage colon cancer. This investigation was a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients with early-stage colon cancer from the province of Ontario, Canada. Electronic records of treatment were linked to the Ontario Cancer Registry to identify all patients with colon cancer who underwent resection between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. The date of the final analysis was October 20, 2016. The study population included a 25% random sample of all patients with resected stage I to III disease. Right-sided colon cancer was defined as any tumor arising in the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, or transverse colon. Left-sided colon cancer was defined as any tumor arising in the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectosigmoid colon. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) measured from the time of resection. This study identified 6365 patients with early-stage colon cancer (48.7% [3098 of 6365] female). Their median age was 72 years, and 51.7% (3291 of 6365) had right-sided disease. Stage distribution was 18.3% (1163 of 6365) stage I, 38.4% (2446 of 6365) stage II, and 43.3% (2756 of 6365) stage III. Patients with right-sided colon cancer were more likely to be older (median age, 73 vs 70 years; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) and female (54.4% [1790 of 3291] vs 42.6% [1308 of 3074], Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) and have greater comorbidity. Right-sided cancers were more likely to be T4 (19.2% [631 of 3291] vs 15.9% [490 of 3074], Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) and poorly differentiated (21.1% [695 of 3291] vs 9.6% [295 of 3074], Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) but less likely to be node positive (42.0% [1383 of 3291] vs 44.7% [1373 of 3074], Pâ€‰=â€‰.03) compared with left-sided disease. In adjusted analyses, there was no difference in long-term survival for right-sided compared with left-sided colon cancer: the hazard ratios were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.92-1.08) for OS and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.91-1.10) for CSS. These results were consistent when the survival analyses were restricted to stage III disease: the hazard ratios were 1.03 (95% CI, 0.93-1.14) for OS and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.97-1.24) for CSS.

In this post hoc analysis with updated follow-up and data regarding sidedness, we defined subgroups according to RAS/BRAF mutation status and mismatch repair (MMR) status, and investigated their influence on treatment efficacy. A total of 558 patients with previously untreated mCRC and stable disease or better after six cycles CAPOX-B induction treatment were randomised to either CAP-B maintenance treatment (nâ€‰=â€‰279) or observation (nâ€‰=â€‰279). Upon first progression, patients were to receive CAPOX-B reintroduction until second progression (PFS2, primary end point). We centrally assessed RAS/BRAF mutation status and MMR status, or used local results if central assessment was not possible. Intention-to-treat stratified Cox models adjusted for baseline covariables were used to examine whether treatment efficacy was modified by RAS/BRAF mutation status. RAS, BRAF mutations, and MMR deficiency were detected in 240/420 (58%), 36/381 (9%), and 4/279 (1%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 87â€‰months (IQR 69-97), all mutational subgroups showed significant improvement from maintenance treatment for the primary end point PFS2 [RAS/BRAF wild-type: hazard ratio (HR) 0.57 (95% CI 0.39-0.84); RAS-mutant: HR 0.74 (0.55-0.98); V600EBRAF-mutant: HR 0.28 (0.12-0.64)] and secondary end points, except for the RAS-mutant subgroup regarding overall survival. Adjustment for sidedness instead of primary tumour location yielded comparable results. Although right-sided tumours were associated with inferior prognosis, both patients with right- and left-sided tumours showed significant benefit from maintenance treatment. CAP-B maintenance treatment after six cycles CAPOX-B is effective in first-line treatment of mCRC across all mutational subgroups.

It is also uncertain if BRAF mutation contributes to the impact of tumor location on survival. We assessed the prognostic impact of tumor location on clinical outcomes in mCRC patients treated with first-line cetuximab chemotherapy. The associations of tumor location with overall survival and progression-free survival were evaluated in mCRC patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors who were enrolled onto 2 clinical trials: JACCRO CC-05 of cetuximab plus FOLFOX (nÂ = 57, UMIN000004197) and CC-06 of cetuximab plus SOX (nÂ = 61, UMIN000007022). Tumors proximal or from splenic flexure to rectum were defined as right-sided or left-sided, respectively. In addition, exploratory RAS and BRAF mutation analyses were performed.

The aim was to compare morbidity rates after colonic stenting bridge to surgery (SBTS) versus emergency surgery (ES) for left-sided malignant obstruction. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on SBTS or ES for acute symptomatic malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction. The primary outcome was overall morbidity within 60 days after surgery. The meta-analysis included 8 RCTs and 497 patients. Overall mortality within 60 days after surgery was 9.6% in SBTS-treated patients and 9.9% in ES-treated patients (relative risk [RR], 0.99; PÂ = .97). Overall morbidity within 60 days after surgery was 33.9% in SBTS-treated patients and 51.2% in ES-treated patients (RR, 0.59; PÂ = .023). The temporary stoma rate was 33.9% after SBTS and 51.4% after ES (RR, 0.67; PÂ &lt;Â .001). The permanent stoma rate was 22.2% after SBTS and 35.2% after ES (RR, 0.66; PÂ = .003). PrimaryÂ anastomosis was successful in 70.0% of SBTS-treated patients and 54.1% of ES-treated patients (RR, 1.29; PÂ = .043). SBTS was associated with lower short-term overall morbidity and lower rates of temporary and permanent stoma.

Despite the concomitant improvements in response rate, duration of response and patient survival, reports of serious toxic pulmonary side effects have progressively emerged. We describe a patient who was treated with FOLFOX as an adjuvant to a rectosigmoidal resection of a rectosigmoidal carcinoma and who developed respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging and open lung biopsy findings were compatible with interstitial pneumonia (IP). She received multimodal combination treatment (acetylcysteine, corticosteroids, immune globulins and cyclophosphamide) and survived. We performed a systematic literature search and reviewed all 45 reported cases of FOLFOX-related lung toxicity and/or pulmonary fibrosis for their clinical characteristics and their outcomes related to therapy. We found that for the 45 cases with available data, the median age was 70Â years, and the male-female ratio was 3.5: 1. In the patients exhibiting only mild respiratory symptoms, discontinuation of the culprit drug (oxaliplatin) resulted in a 100% regression of the symptoms. However the prognosis of the respiratory insufficient patient proved to be grim: death occurred in 76.9% of the cases despite conventional treatment with corticosteroids. We therefore urge oncologists and critical care specialists not to limit their interventions to the discontinuation of chemotherapy, artificial ventilation, corticosteroids and glutathione replenishment and to consider the gradual introduction of additional immune-modulating agents whenever life-threatening respiratory symptoms in oxaliplatin-treated patients do not subside; all the more so considering the fact that our analysis showed that every patient who survived intubation and mechanical ventilation experienced a full clinical recovery.";"2018";"BMC cancer";"Case report and review; Chemotherapy lung; Cyclophosphamide; Drug induced pulmonary toxicity; FOLFOX; Immune globulins; Interstitial lung disease; Interstitial pneumonia; Oxaliplatin toxicity; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Colorectal Neoplasms; Combined Modality Therapy; Cyclophosphamide; Female; Fluorouracil; Humans; Immunotherapy; Leucovorin; Lung Diseases, Interstitial; Male; Middle Aged; Organoplatinum Compounds; Prognosis; Respiration, Artificial; Sigmoid Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome"

No significant difference was identified in expression levels of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, Î²-Tubulin III, P53, Ki67 and TOPIIÎ±, and gene mutation of KRAS and BRAF among three groups. Progression Free Survival (PFS) of RSCC was significantly lower than that of LRCC and rectal cancer. In univariate analyses, RSCC, preoperative chemoradiotherapy, poor differentiation, advanced TNM stage, elevated serum CEA and CA19-9 level, tumor deposit, perineural and vascular invasion were found to be predictive factors of shorter PFS. In multivariate analyses, only differentiation and TNM stages were found to be independent predictors of PFS. In conclusion, compared with LSCC and rectal cancer, RSCC has larger tumor size, poor differentiation, advanced TNM stage and shorter survival. The shorter survival in RSCC might be attributed to the advanced tumor stage caused by its inherent position feature of proximal colon rather than genetic difference.";"2019";"Scientific reports";"Aged; Colon; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Mutation; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Progression-Free Survival; Proteome; Proteomics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Rectal Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies"

As a means to induce hypertrophy, portal vein embolization (PVE) has been widely applied before extending hepatectomy.

The present retrospective analysis of two panitumumab trials investigated a possible association between tumor sidedness and treatment efficacy in first-line mCRC patients with RAS wild-type (WT) primary tumors. Data from two randomized first-line panitumumab trials were analyzed for treatment outcomes by primary tumor sidedness for RAS WT patients. PRIME (phase 3; NCT00364013) compared panitumumab plus FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone; PEAK (phase 2; NCT00819780) compared panitumumab plus FOLFOX versus bevacizumab plus FOLFOX. Primary tumors located in the cecum to transverse colon were coded as right-sided, while tumors located from the splenic flexure to rectum were considered left-sided. Tumor sidedness ascertainment (RAS WT population) was 83% (nâ€‰=â€‰559/675); 78% of patients (nâ€‰=â€‰435) had left-sided and 22% (nâ€‰=â€‰124) had right-sided tumors. Patients with right-sided tumors did worse for all efficacy parameters compared with patients with left-sided disease in the RAS WT population and also in the RAS/BRAF WT subgroup. In patients with left-sided tumors, panitumumab provided better outcomes than the comparator treatment, including on median overall survival (PRIME: 30.3 versus 23.6â€‰months, adjusted hazard ratioâ€‰=â€‰0.73, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0112; PEAK: 43.4 versus 32.0â€‰months, adjusted hazard ratioâ€‰=â€‰0.77, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.3125). The results of these retrospective analyses confirm that in RAS WT patients, right-sided primary tumors are associated with worse prognosis than left-sided tumors, regardless of first-line treatment received. RAS WT patients with left-sided tumors derive greater benefit from panitumumab-containing treatment than chemotherapy alone or combined with bevacizumab, including an overall survival advantage (treatment difference: PRIME 6.7â€‰months; PEAK 11.4â€‰months).

Herein, we develop a novel hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) with complete mesocolic excision (CME), D3 lymphadenectomy, and a total &quot;no-touch&quot; isolation technique (HALS-CME) in right hemicolectomy to overcome these issues. According to previous clinic practice, this novel procedure is not only feasible and safe but has several technical merits. However, the feasibility, short-term minimally invasive virtues, long-term oncological superiority, and potential total &quot;no-touch&quot; isolation technique benefits of HALS-CME should be confirmed by a prospective randomized controlled trial. This is a single-center, open-label, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the HALS-CME group or to the laparoscopic surgery with CME, D3 lymphadenectomy, and total &quot;no-touch&quot; isolation technique (LAP-CME) group, or to conventional laparoscopic surgery with CME and D3 lymphadenectomy (cLAP) group at a 1:1:1 ratio using a centralized randomization list. Primary endpoints include safety, efficacy, and being oncologically clear, and 3-year disease-free, progression-free, and overall survival. Second endpoints include operative outcomes (operation time, blood loss, and incision length), pathologic evaluation (grading the plane of surgery, length of proximal and distal resection margins, distance between the tumor and the central arterial high tie, distance between the nearest bowel wall and the same high tie, area of mesentery resected, width of the chain of lymph-adipose tissue, length of the central lymph-adipose chain, number of harvested lymph nodes), and postoperative outcomes (pain intensity, postoperative inflammatory and immune responses, postoperative recovery). This trial will provide valuable clinical evidence for the feasibility, safety, and potential total &quot;no-touch&quot; isolation technique benefits of HALS-CME for right hemicolectomy. The hypothesis is that HALS-CME is feasible for the radical D3 resection of right colon cancer and offers short-term safety and long-term oncological superiority compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery.

However, an in-deep molecular selection might overcome the predictive role of primary tumour location in this setting. We conducted a retrospective analysis in which tumour samples from RAS/BRAF wild-type (WT) metastatic CRC patients treated with second-third-line irinotecan/cetuximab were analysed for EGFR gene copy number (GCN) and promoter methylation. Study objective was to evaluate the correlation of tumour sidedness, EGFR promoter methylation and EGFR GCN with clinical outcome. Median follow-up duration was 14.3 months. Eighty-eight patients were included in the study, 27.3% had right-sided CRC, 72.7% had left-sided CRC; 36.4% had EGFR GCN&lt;2.12 tumour, 63.6% had EGFR GCNâ©¾2.12 tumour; 50% had EGFR promoter-methylated tumour. Right-sided colorectal cancer (RSCRC) were associated with reduced overall response rate (ORR) (4.2% for RSCRC vs 35.9% for left sided colorectal cancer (LSCRC), P=0.0030), shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (3.0 vs 6.75 months, P&lt;0.0001) and shorter overall survival (OS) (8 vs 13.6 months, P&lt;0.0001). EGFR GCN&lt;2.12 tumours were associated with reduced ORR (6.2% for EGFR GCN&lt;2.12 vs 39.3% for EGFR GCNâ©¾2.12 tumours, P=0.0009), shorter PFS (3.5 vs 6.5 months, P=0.0006) and shorter OS (8.5 vs 14.0 months, P&lt;0.0001). Epidermal growth factor receptor-methylated tumours were associated with reduced ORR (9.1% for methylated vs 45.5% for unmethylated, P=0.0001), shorter PFS (3 vs 7.67 months, P&lt;0.0001) and shorter OS (8 vs 17 months, P&lt;0.0001). At multivariate analysis, EGFR GCN and EGFR promoter methylation maintained their independent role for ORR (respectively P=0.0082 and 0.0025), PFS (respectively P=0.0048 and&lt;0.0001) and OS (respectively P=0.0001 and&lt;0.0001). In our study, an accurate molecular selection based on an all RAS and BRAF analysis along with EGFR GCN and EGFR promoter methylation status seems to be more relevant than primary tumour sidedness in the prediction of clinical outcome during cetuximab/irinotecan therapy.

There are now several treatment options for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In addition to chemotherapy backbones utilizing fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan combinations, biologic agents that target specific oncogenic pathways have contributed to the improved survival observed in this patient population. This class of medications includes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted drugs (cetuximab and panitumumab) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapies (bevacizumab, ramucirumab, ziv-aflibercept, and regorafenib). Bevacizumab remains the only VEGF-targeted agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in the first-line metastatic setting. EGFR-directed treatment should be restricted to patients with extended RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors. Tumor sidedness may be a more powerful prognostic and predictive biomarker than tumor mutational profile. Patients with left-sided primary tumors derive greater benefit from EGFR-targeted therapies whereas patients with right-sided primary tumors benefit more from bevacizumab.

Multiple lymphomatous polyposis originates from the mantle zone of the lymphoma follicle and is considered to be a mantle cell lymphoma, which is a relatively aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We report an unusual case of a patient with multiple lymphomatous polyposis with extensive colorectal involvement and acute intestinal obstruction, an atypical complication of this rare disease. On the basis of this case study, the pitfalls in gastrointestinal tract lymphomatous polyposis diagnosis and prognosis, as well as the treatment options, are discussed. Our patient was a 76-year-old white woman with asthenia, cramps, and swelling in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen, as well as weight loss within the previous 5 months. A colonoscopy revealed polyps in the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, and right and left colic flexures. A biopsy revealed lymphomatous infiltration of the intestinal wall. Because of the large size of the polypoid masses, which narrowed the colonic lumen in multiple locations, the patient developed acute intestinal obstruction and was referred for laparotomy. She underwent a total proctocolectomy with a permanent ileostomy and a left salpingo-oophorectomy. Microscopic examination showed the presence of a multicentric, low-grade, small lymphocytic lymphoma. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive immunostaining for CD79a, CD20, and CD45. These results were consistent with the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma. Two weeks after surgery and prior to discharge, but before the beginning of chemotherapy, the patient's general condition worsened as she experienced a severe and progressive respiratory tract infection, advanced respiratory insufficiency, and septic shock, and she ultimately died. Mantle cell lymphoma develops as a progressive and aggressive disease with widespread polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract. The intensive chemotherapeutic regimens usually result in the regression of macroscopic and microscopic lesions; however, remissions are short in duration, and the median length of patient survival is 3-4 years. Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare disease that should be part of the differential diagnosis of polypoid diseases of the large intestine.";"2018";"Journal of medical case reports";"Colorectal neoplasms; Intestinal obstruction; Intestinal polyposis; Lymphoma; Mantle cell lymphoma; Non-Hodgkin lymphoma; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diagnosis, Differential; Fatal Outcome; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell; Proctocolectomy, Restorative"

Here, we evaluated subsite-specific trends in CRC incidence rate between 1978 and 2004 in Japan using large data from 10 population-based cancer registries. The colorectal sites (C18-C20) were categorized into three groups: proximal colon (C18.0-C18.5), distal colon (C18.6-C18.7), and rectum (C19.9 and C20.9). Trends in age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were characterized by joinpoint regression analysis. A total of 303â€‰802 CRC cases were analyzed. Overall, ASRs increased remarkably until 1993, with an annual percentage change (APC) of 4.9%, and then stabilized thereafter. By subsite, however, ASRs of proximal colon significantly increased, with APCs of 7.1% (1978-1991), 3.8% (1991-1996), and 0.9% (1996-2004); distal colon showed an initial significant increase, with an APC of 7.6%, but stabilized from 1991 until the end of observation; and rectal cancer showed an initial significant increase, with APCs of 1.9% (1978-1988) and 5.6% (1988-1992), but then decreased abruptly in 1992, the year CRC screening was introduced nationwide, with an APC of -1.0%.

Clinicopathological and follow-up data of 2 174 colon carcinoma cases undergoing resection at Shanghai Changhai Hospital of The Second Military Medical University from January 2000 to December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with transverse colon cancer, overlapping position, unknown location, recurrent cancer, multiple primary cancer, concomitant malignant tumors, preoperative chemotherapy, local resection, incomplete clinical data and missed follow up were excluded. Finally, a total of 1 036 patients, whose primary tumors were radically removed, were enrolled, with 563 patients in LC group (including carcinoma in cecum, ascending colon and hepatic flexure) and 473 in RC group (including carcinoma in splenic flexure, descending colon and sigmoid colon). The clinicopathological features and survival, including median overall survival, 5-year overall survival rate, tumor specific median overall survival, cancer specific 5-year overall survival rate, were compared between LC and RC groups. Tumor specific overall survival was defined as the period between operation date to the date of death caused by cancer progression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to analyze the influencing factors of survival. Propensity score matching was carried out to balance the clinicopathological factors between the two groups with the SAS 9.3, taking the following parameters into consideration (age, gender, gross appearance, tumor diameter, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, TNM stages, differentiation, CEA and CA199-9). Patients in RC group and LC group were matched according to the propensity scores and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of two groups were compared again. No significant differences were identified between the two groups in age, distant metastasis and serum CEA level. Compared with RC group, LC group had more male patients [60.9%(343/563) vs. 51.0%(241/473), P=0.001], more ulcerative tumors [71.9% (405/563) vs. 65.3%(309/473), P=0.006], better differentiation [well/moderately differentiated: 87.5%(493/563) vs. 73.8%(349/473), P=0.000], lower infiltration depth [T1-2: 17.1%(96/563) vs. 10.1%(48/473), P=0.001], higher lymph node metastasis rate [N0: 53.3%(300/563) vs. 62.4%(295/473), P=0.013], lower TNM stage [stage I(: 13.3%(75/563) vs. 7.8%(37/473), P=0.000], lower serum CA199 level [&lt;37 kU/L: 68.4% (385/563) vs. 62.6% (296/473), P=0.022] and smaller tumor diameter [&lt;5.0 cm: 55.1%(310/563) vs. 38.3%(181/473), P=0.000].

Neoplastic lesions of the duodenum are treated conventionally by pancreaticoduodenectomy. Lesions distal to the major papilla may be suitable for a pancreas-preserving distal duodenectomy, potentially reducing morbidity and mortality. We present our experience with this procedure. Selective intraoperative duodenoscopy assessed the relationship of the papilla to the lesion. After duodenal mobilisation and confirmation of the site of the lesion, the duodenum was transected distal to the papilla and beyond the duodenojejunal flexure and a side-to-side duodeno-jejunal anastomosis was formed. Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database and outcomes determined from digital health records with a dataset including demographics, co-morbidities, mode of presentation, preoperative imaging and assessment, nutritional support needs, technical operative details, blood transfusion requirements, length of stay, pathology including lymph node yield and lymph node involvement, length of follow-up, complications and outcomes. Related published literature was also reviewed. Twenty-four patients had surgery with the intent of performing PPDD from 2003 to 2016. Nineteen underwent PPDD successfully. Two patients planned for PPDD proceeded to formal pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) while three had unresectable disease. Median post-operative follow-up was 32 mo.

Only studies that conducted colonoscopy in all subjects were included. PubMed and Web of Science were searched until May 13, 2016. Reference lists of eligible studies were also screened. Sensitivity of FS was derived from colonoscopy results, assuming the same sensitivity as colonoscopy for left-sided neoplasms and follow-up colonoscopy after detection of distal adenomas. Bivariate meta-analyses were used to derive summary estimates of overall sensitivity and specificity of individual and joint application of both tests. Ten eligible studies were identified. Summary estimates (95% confidence intervals) of overall sensitivity for detecting CRC and AA were 65% (56-74%) and 27% (23-31%) for FIT alone, 67% (58-75%) and 67% (59-75%) for FS alone, and 89% (83-92%) and 75% (68-80%), respectively, for the combination of both tests.

This study examined the frequency of SAC morphology in MACs. We assessed the correlation of SAC morphology with clinicopathological parameters, molecular characteristics, and patient prognosis. Eighty-eight colorectal MACs were collected and reviewed for SAC morphology according to Makinen's criteria. We sequenced KRAS and BRAF, assessed CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) frequency, and analyzed DNA mismatch repair enzyme levels using immunohistochemistry in tumor samples. SAC morphology was observed in 38% of MACs, and was associated with proximal location (P=0.001), BRAF mutation (P=0.042), CIMP-positive status (P=0.023), and contiguous traditional serrated adenoma (P=0.019). Multivariate analysis revealed that MACs without both SAC morphology and CIMP-positive status exhibited 3.955 times greater risk of cancer relapse than MACs having both characteristics or either one (P=0.035).

We seek to confirm primary tumour location as an independent prognostic factor in locoregional colorectal cancer. All patients with stage I - III primary adenocarcinoma of colon were identified from the New South Wales (NSW) clinical cancer registry (2006-2013). Primary tumour location (RsCC vs LsCC) survival analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and adjusted hazard ratios for 5-year all-cause mortality (OS) and 5-year cancer specific mortality (CSS) were obtained using Cox proportional hazards regression. We identified 9509 patients including 5051 patients with RsCC and 4458 with LsCC.

To determine the association of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status and somatic mutation in the B-Raf proto-oncogene (c.1799T&gt;A [V600E]; BRAFV600E) or exon 2 of the KRAS proto-oncogene (KRAS) in the primary tumor with SAR in patients with stage III colon carcinomas treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with resected stage III colon cancers were randomized to adjuvant FOLFOX (folinic acid [leucovorin calcium], fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy with or without cetuximab (North Central Cancer Treatment Group N0147 trial) or adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project C-08 trial). Associations of biomarkers with SAR were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinicopathologic features and time to recurrence (data collected February 10, 2004, to August 7, 2015). The primary study outcome was survival after recurrence of cancer. A secondary outcome measure was the effect of the site of the primary tumor on the association of biomarkers with SAR. Among 871 patients with cancer recurrence in the N0147 trial (472 men [54.2%] and 399 women [45.8%]; mean [SD] age, 57.8 [11.2] years) and 524 in the C-08 trial (269 men [51.3%] and 255 women [48.7%]; mean [SD] age, 57.0 [11.7] years), multivariable analysis revealed that patients whose tumors had deficient vs proficient MMR had significantly better SAR (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96; Pâ€‰=â€‰.03). Patients whose tumors harbored mutant BRAFV600E (AHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.85-3.25; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) or mutant KRAS (AHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.47; Pâ€‰=â€‰.052) had worse SAR compared with those whose tumors had wild-type copies of both genes, although only results for BRAFV600E achieved statistical significance. Significant interactions were found for MMR (Pâ€‰=â€‰.03) and KRAS (Pâ€‰=â€‰.02) by primary tumor site for SAR. Improved SAR was observed for patients with deficient MMR tumors of the proximal vs distal colon (AHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40-0.83; Pâ€‰=â€‰.003), and worse SAR was observed for tumors of the distal colon with mutant KRAS in codon 12 (AHR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.30-2.38; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) and codon 13 (AHR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.08-2.86; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02).

The results of the six major clinical trials were analysed. Insufficiencies of the meta-analysis are pointed: the lack of homogeneity among control groups, the omission of later lines of therapy, the inconsistency between progression free and overall survival benefit and the high proportion of excluded patients. The trials confirm the worse prognosis of right sided versus left sided colorectal cancers. To date the data are not strong enough to support the preference of any of the available targeted agents at the first line setting in the treatment of left sided metastatic RAS and BRAF wild type colorectal cancers.

Complete mesocolic excision (CME), in which more extensive lymph node (LN) dissection is performed, has been shown in single-centre studies with historical controls to be associated with better oncological outcome. However, better evidence is needed. The main purpose of this PhD thesis was to investigate whether CME could be implemented in a colorectal surgical department in Denmark, whether more extensive dissection could demonstrate LN metastases outside the mesocolon, and to demonstrate a possible association between CME and improved oncological results without increased risk of perioperative mortality. This thesis includes five articles. Two articles (IV and V) are based on the population of patients undergoing elective resection for colon cancer in the Capital Region from June 2008 to December 2013. Two articles (II and III) are based on data from the local colon database in HillerÃ¸d, and the last article (I) is a systematic review concerning the risk of metastases from colon cancer to the central LNs in the mesocolon. Article I found a risk of metastases in central LNs to be reported in 1-22% of the cases of right-sided colon cancers, and in up to 12% of the cases with sigmoid tumours. The populations included and methods used in the studies were very heterogeneous and no definitive conclusions can be drawn. It was shown in article II that the surgical quality, i.e. quality of the specimens assessed by the pathologists, improved with implementation of CME in HillerÃ¸d. The vascular tie was higher, and the implementation was not associated with an increased risk of perioperative mortality. Article III demonstrated a risk of LN metastases in the gastrocolic ligament along the stomach for tumours located in the transverse colon, in the ascending or descending colon close to or in the flexures. It occurred in 4% of all patients and 13% of the patients with LN metastases in mesocolon. Resection of these LNs seems advisable for these tumour locations. Article IV showed no association between increased perioperative mortality and CME (n = 529) when compared with non-CME (n = 1,701). The 30-day mortality was 4.2% after CME compared with 3.7% after non-CME (p = 0.605), and the 90-day mortalities were 6.2% and 4.9% (p = 0.219) respectively. Odds ratios for 30-day and 90-day mortalities after CME were respectively 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 0.62-1.80) and 1.25 (0.77-1.94) in the multi-variable logistic regression analyses. Postoperative respiratory failure and need for vasopressors were significantly more frequent in the CME group and, besides CME itself, could be associated with the fewer laparoscopic resections and more severe preoperative comorbidity in the CME Group. Article V demonstrated an association between higher four-year disease-free survival for stage I-III tumours and CME (n = 364) when compared with non-CME (n = 1,031). Most notable was the difference for stage I and II cancers. The four-year disease-free survival for stage I was 100% in the CME group compared with 89.8% (83.1-96.6) in the non-CME group (p = 0.046). For stage II the disease-free survivals were 91.9% (87.2-96.6%) in the CME group and 77.9% (71.6-84.1%) in the non-CME group (p = 0.0033), and for stage III 73.5% (63.6-83.5) and 67.5% (61.8-73.2) (p = 0.13) respectively. In the multivariable Cox regression models, CME was a significant predictive factor for higher dis-ease-free four-year survival for stage I-III patients with hazard ratios (HR) for CME of 0.59 (0.42-0.83, p = 0.0025). For stage II the HR was 0.44 (0.23-0.86, p = 0.018) and for stage III 0.64 (0.42-1.00, p = 0.048).";"2017";"Danish medical journal";"Adenocarcinoma; Colon; Colonic Neoplasms; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Disease-Free Survival; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mesocolon; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"

We report our initial experience with robotic transanal total mesorectal excision (R-taTME) and radical proctectomy using the robotic single-site plus one-port (R-SSPO) technique for low rectal surgery. Between July 2015 and March 2016, 15 consecutive patients with ultra-low rectal lesions underwent R-taTME followed by radical proctectomy using the R-SSPO technique by a single surgeon. The clinical and pathological results were retrospectively analyzed. The median operative time was 473 (range, 335-569)Â min, and the estimated blood loss was 33 (range, 30-50)Â mL. The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 12 (range, 8-18). The median distal resection margin was 1.4 (range, 0.4-3.5)Â cm, and all patients had clear circumferential resection margins. We encountered a left ureteric transection intraoperatively in one patient, and another patient required reoperation for postoperative adhesive intestinal obstruction. There was no 30-day mortality. R-taTME followed by radical proctectomy using the R-SSPO technique for patients with low rectal lesions is technically feasible and safe without compromising oncologic outcomes.

The incidence of CRC during 2010-2012 averaged 1021 females and 1424 males per year.

Proximal tumours occurred more frequently in females (F vs. M, 38 vs. 29Â %), in older persons and increased over time. Compared to distal colon tumours, proximal colon [RR risk ratio 1.08, 95Â % CI (1.05, 1.10)] and RSJ/rectum tumours [RR 1.08 (1.05, 1.11)] were more likely to be diagnosed at late stage.

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, LILACS, CINAHL, and SCOPUS for prospective or retrospective studies reporting data on overall survival for left-sided colon cancer (LCC) compared with right-sided colon cancer (RCC). Studies were selected if: (1) side of CC was reported among variables entered into survival analysis, (2) survival information was available (overall survival [OS] was reported in the article as hazard ratio (HR) according to multivariate analysis, (3) articles were published in the English language. Data were pooled using HRs for OS of LCC vs RCC according to fixed or random-effects models. Subgroup analysis and multivariate random-effects model meta-regression was also implemented adjusting for stage distribution, sample size, race, year of publication, type and quality of studies, and adjuvant chemotherapy. HRs for OS (the primary outcome measure) were pooled to provide an aggregate value. In this analysis, all HRs with 95% CIs were pooled to obtain prognostic information on the location of the primary tumor (left vs right location site of CC) independent of other common clinicopathological covariates. An analysis was made from the 66 studies conducted. It included 1â€¯437â€¯846 patients with a median follow-up of 65 months. Left sided primary tumor location was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.84; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) and this was independent of stage, race, adjuvant chemotherapy, year of study, number of participants, and quality of included studies. Based on these results, CC side should be acknowledged as a criterion for establishing prognosis in all stages of disease.

To examine the prognostic and predictive value of primary tumor location in patients with RAS wild-type (wt) mCRC treated with first-line fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus cetuximab in the Cetuximab Combined With Irinotecan in First-line Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRYSTAL) trial and FOLFIRI Plus Cetuximab Versus FOLFIRI Plus Bevacizumab as First-Line Treatment For Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (FIRE-3) trial. In this retrospective analysis patients with RAS wt metastatic colorectal cancer from the CRYSTAL and FIRE-3 trials were classified as having left-sided or right-sided mCRC, defined, respectively, as patients whose tumors originated in the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum vs appendix, cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, or transverse colon.

We conducted a meta-analysis of first-line clinical trials available up to October 2016, which assessed the relevance of PTL in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Right- and left-sided colorectal cancers were differentiated (RC and LC). In 13 first-line randomised controlled trialsÂ and one prospective pharmacogenetic study, RC was associated with a significantly worse prognosis compared with LC (hazard ratio [HR] for overall survival: 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-1.70; PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). A meta-analysis of PRIME and CRYSTAL study suggests that PTL was predictive of survival benefit from addition of anti-EGFR antibody to standard chemotherapy in patients with RAS wild-type tumour (overall survival, HR for LC: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.58-0.83; PÂ &lt;Â 0.0001 and HR for RC: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.68-1.35; PÂ =Â 0.802). A meta-analysis of FIRE-3/AIO KRK0306, CALGB/SWOG 80405 and PEAK study indicates that patients with RAS wild-type LC had a significantly greater survival benefit from anti-EGFR treatment compared with anti-VEGF treatment when added to standard chemotherapy (HR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.58-0.85; PÂ =Â 0.0003). By contrast, in patients with RC, benefit from standard therapy was poor and bevacizumab-based treatment was numerically associated with longer survival (HR 1.3; 95% CI: 0.97-1.74; PÂ =Â 0.081). The present meta-analysis demonstrates that PTL is prognostic in mCRC. Further, it supports the conclusion that patients with left-sided RAS wild-type mCRC should be preferentially treated with an anti-EGFR antibody.

This highlights a relatively rare cause of bowel obstruction, but also the importance of breast self-examination as a compliment to the current BreastScreen Australia program. A 67-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with a 48-h history of sharp, constant epigastric pain, vomiting and constipation. The patient proceeded to emergency laparotomy for presumed large bowel obstruction, which revealed a stricture in the distal terminal ileum causing a distal small bowel obstruction. A right hemicolectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed the terminal ileum stricture to be metastatic lobular breast carcinoma. Clinical examination of the patient's right breast revealed a lesion suggestive of the primary malignancy despite a normal ultrasound and mammogram in 2014. After failing to progress, a CT scan was performed which revealed progressive small and large bowel distension. A repeat laparotomy was performed revealing dilated large bowel without obstructing pathology and an intact anastomosis. A loop ileostomy was performed. Following a further febrile episode, the patient decided to withdraw care and the patient passed away three weeks into her admission from suspected intra-abdominal sepsis.

The study included 57847 patients: 43.5% with RCC, 37.7% with LCC, and 18.8% with ReC. Compared with LCC and ReC, RCC was more likely to affect old patients and women, and to be at advanced stage, poorly differentiated or un-differentiated, and mucinous. Patients with LCC or ReC had better DSS than those with RCC in subgroups including stage III or IV disease, age â‰¤70 years and non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. Conversely, patients with LCC or ReC had worse DSS than those with RCC in subgroups including age Ëƒ70 years and mucinous adenocarcinoma.

The patient was an 80-year-old with an upper rectal adenocarcinoma and significant cardiovascular risk factors. Fluorescence angiography with 0.4Â mg/kg of ICG was administered intravenously just before the colorectal anastomosis was fashioned. A near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopic camera (KARLSTORZ, GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) was used to inspect the anastomosis. For this video, 0.4Â mg/kg of ICG also was injected after ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery to demonstrate the appearance of a poorly perfused sigmoid bowel. Just before the staple was fired to fashion the colorectal anastomosis, an intravenous bolus of ICG was administered. Within seconds, vessels on both ends of the anastomosis turned fluorescent blue, indicating adequacy of perfusion. The use of ICG did not significantly lengthen the operative time (285Â min) because its effect appeared within seconds after its administration. The patient recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 5. Another four patients who also underwent intraoperative fluorescent angiography for left-sided colorectal lesions did not experience anastomotic leakage. The study showed that ICG fluorescent angiography is a simple and quick intraoperative tool for evaluating the perfusion of the anastomosis. The authors' experience with ICG fluorescent angiography has shown promising results, with a 0Â % anastomotic leak rate.";"2018";"Annals of surgical oncology";"Adenocarcinoma; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Perfusion Imaging; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum"

This study characterizes variation in hospital-specific rates of suboptimal lymphadenectomy and its effect on overall survival in a national hospital-based registry. Stage I-III colon cancer patients were identified from the 2003-2012 National Cancer Data Base. Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of patient- and hospital-level factors on hospital-specific rates of suboptimal lymphadenectomy (&lt;12 lymph nodes), and multilevel Cox models were used to estimate the effect of suboptimal lymphadenectomy at the patient (yes vs. no) and hospital level (quartiles of hospital-specific rates) on overall survival. A total of 360,846 patients across 1345 hospitals in the US met the inclusion criteria, of which 25Â % had a suboptimal lymphadenectomy. Wide variation was observed in hospital-specific rates of suboptimal lymphadenectomy (range 0-82Â %, median 44Â %). Older age, male sex, comorbidity score, no insurance, positive margins, lower tumor grade, lower T and N stage, and sigmoid and left colectomy were associated with higher odds of suboptimal lymphadenectomy. Patients treated at lower-volume and non-academic hospitals had higher odds of suboptimal lymphadenectomy. Patient- and hospital-level factors explained 5Â % of the between-hospital variability in suboptimal lymphadenectomy, leaving 95Â % unexplained. Higher suboptimal lymphadenectomy rates were associated with worse survival (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: hazard ratio 1.19, 95Â % confidence interval 1.16-1.22). Large differences in hospital-specific rates of suboptimal lymphadenectomy were observed, and this variation was associated with survival. Quality improvement initiatives targeting hospital-level adherence to the national standard may improve overall survival among resected colon cancer patients.";"2018";"Annals of surgical oncology";"Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colectomy; Colon, Descending; Colon, Sigmoid; Colonic Neoplasms; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Female; Hospitals, High-Volume; Hospitals, Low-Volume; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Insurance, Health; Lymph Node Excision; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Sex Factors; Survival Rate"

We sought to characterize the prognostic implications of primary tumor location among patients who underwent curative-intent hepatectomy for CRLM. Tumors of the cecum, ascending, and transverse colon were defined as right-sided; tumors of the sigmoid flexure, descending, and sigmoid colon were defined as left-sided. Clinicopathologic and long-term survival data were collected and assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses. About 475 patients who underwent CRLM resection at a single institution were included; most patients had left-sided tumors (nâ€‰=â€‰284). Median and 5-year RFS was 20.2 months and 28.0%, respectively. Patients who had a left-sided primary tumor had a shorter RFS compared with patients who had a right-sided tumor (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Although site of and time to recurrence did not differ between the two groups (Pâ€‰&gt;â€‰0.05), patients with right-sided primary tumors were more likely to recur with advanced disease (i.e., â‰¥4 recurrent lesions) (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). In turn, patients with right-sided tumors had both worse OS (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and worse survival after recurrence (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01).

The patient was a young woman who suffered from locally advanced urachal carcinoma treated with en-bloc cystectomy, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy, partial resection of the sigmoid colon, and partial resection of the rectus abdominis muscle with the fascia, skin, and umbilicus. Adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin was applied. Two years after the treatment, she was diagnosed with a single liver metastasis and a local pelvic recurrence. In a two-step operation, the patient underwent right hemihepatectomy as well as resection of pelvic recurrence site and adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine. Due to the disease progression, a complete resection of the lesions was not achieved and the response to chemotherapy was poor. The patient died of the disease after a year.

While some studies have reported long-term outcomes after laparoscopic surgery from single institutions, data from large patient cohorts are sparse. We investigated short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic and open surgery for treating colon cancer in a large national cohort. We retrieved data from the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Registry for all colon cancer resections performed in 2007-2010. Five-year relative survival rates following laparoscopic and open surgeries were calculated, including excess mortality rates associated with potential predictors of death. Among 8707 patients with colon cancer that underwent major resections, 16Â % and 36Â % received laparoscopic procedures in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Laparoscopic procedures were most common in elective surgeries for treating stages I-III, right colon, or sigmoid tumours. The conversion rate of laparoscopic procedures was 14.5Â %. Among all patients, laparoscopy provided higher 5-year relative survival rates (70Â %) than open surgery (62Â %) (PÂ =Â 0.040), but among the largest group of patients electively treated for stages I-III disease, the approaches provided similar relative survival rates (78 vs. 81Â %; PÂ =Â 0.535). Excess mortality at 2Â years post-surgery was lower after laparoscopy than after open surgery (excess hazard ratio, 0.7; PÂ =Â 0.013), but similar between groups during the last 3Â years of follow-up.

Recent reports suggest that fluorescence evaluation of perfusion after colorectal anastomosis creation is associated with low anastomotic leak rates (1.4%). The purpose of this work was to evaluate whether a similar low anastomotic leak rate after left-sided colorectal resections could be achieved using standard assessment of blood flow to the bowel ends. We performed a retrospective chart review at an academic tertiary referral center, evaluating 317 consecutive patients who underwent a pelvic anastomosis after sigmoid colectomy, left colectomy, or low anterior resection. All operations were performed by a single surgeon from March 2008 to January 2015 with only standard clinical measures used to assess perfusion to the bowel ends. The primary outcome measure was the anastomotic leak rate as diagnosed by clinical symptoms, exam, or routine imaging. The average patient age was 59.7Â years with an average body mass index of 28.8Â kg/m(2). Rectal cancer (128, 40.4%) was the most common indication for operation while hypertension (134, 42.3%) was the most common comorbidity. In total, 177 operations were laparoscopic (55.8%), 13 were reoperative resections (4.1%), and 108 were protected with a loop ileostomy (34.1%). Preoperative chemotherapy was administered to 25 patients (7.9%) while preoperative chemo/radiation was administered to 64 patients (20.2%). The anastomotic leak rate was 1.6% (5/317). Our data suggests that standard, careful evaluation of adequate blood flow via inspection and confirmation of pulsatile blood flow to the bowel ends and meticulous construction of the colorectal or coloanal anastomoses can result in very low leak rates, similar to the rate reported when intraoperative imaging is used to assess perfusion.";"2017";"Surgery";"Academic Medical Centers; Aged; Anastomosis, Surgical; Anastomotic Leak; Cohort Studies; Colectomy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Pulsatile Flow; Regional Blood Flow; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis"

Colonscopy has become the reference procedure for screening and surveillance of colorectal cancer. The overall rate of adverse events is estimated to be about 2.8 per 1,000 procedures, while complications requiring hospitalization are about 1.9 per 1,000 colonoscopies. Mortality from all causes and colonoscopy-specific mortality are estimated to be 0.07 and 0.007%, respectively. An exceptional fearsome postcolonoscopy complication is colon ischemia (CI); only few cases have been reported worldwide. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain; fever and rectal bleeding appeared 12 h after a voluntary 'screening' colonoscopy. She had no risk factors for CI. Her laboratory tests showed alterations in inflammatory markers and a computed tomography scan showed a circumferential thickening in the left colon and free fluid in the abdomen. After 12 h of observation and conservative therapy, the clinical state of the patient worsened with the rising of signs of peritonitis. Laparoscopy showed that colon infarction extended from the distal third of the transverse colon to the proximal rectum. Laparotomy, resection of the pathological colon and terminal colostomy were performed. The specimen examined confirmed an extended ischemic colitis and transmural infarction on the antimesocolic side, in the absence of a vasculitis. The patient underwent recanalization after 8 months. CI after colonoscopy is a rare and alarming complication that must be known and taken into account in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic cases after colonoscopy, particularly in patients with known risk factors. The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical data, imaging and especially endoscopy. Treatment is almost always conservative but, in some cases in which the pathological process appears irreversible, surgery becomes mandatory.";"2019";"Case reports in gastroenterology";"Colon ischemia; Colonoscopy; Ischemic colitis; Risk factors; Surgery"

This trend, however, may vary according to proximal (right) or distal (left) tumor location. We studied if improvement in survival was greater for left than for right CC. We included all CC recorded at the Geneva population-based registry between 1980 and 2006. We compared patients, tumor and treatment characteristics between left and right CC by logistic regression and compared CC specific survival by Cox models taking into account putative confounders. We also compared changes in survival between CC location in early and late years of observation. Among the 3396 CC patients, 1334 (39%) had right-sided and 2062 (61%) left-sided tumors. In the early 1980s, 5-year specific survival was identical for right and left CCs (49% vs. 48%). During the study period, a dramatic improvement in survival was observed for patients with left-sided cancers (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29-0.62, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) but not for right CC patients (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.50-1.14, pÂ =Â 0.69). As a consequence, patients with distal CC have a better outcome than patients with proximal CC (HR for left vs. right CC: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001).

This study analyzed the correlation between body mass index (BMI) and primitive site of polyps. We performed a retrospective study, in a period between January 2010 and October 2014. Subjects aged 50 years and older who underwent their first-time screening colonoscopy were included.

A series of 50 patients undergoing right hemicolectomy for adenocarcinoma underwent specimen evaluation. Preoperative computed tomography images were reconstructed and analysed to determine the direct (vessel origin to caecum) ileocolic pedicle length. The median pathological distance from the tumour to the high vascular tie was 80Â mm, and median nodal yield was 16.5 nodes. Radiological pedicle length did not correlate with the pathological distance from the tumour to the high vascular tie or nodal yield; however, the pathological pedicle length did correlate with the total nodal yield (r (2): 0.343, pÂ =Â 0.015).

Tumor site was defined as right colon, cecum to transverse; left colon, splenic flexure to rectosigmoid; and rectum. Kaplan-Meier and Cox models were used for survival analyses. Of 926 patients, 297 had right colon, 354 left colon, and 275 rectum primary disease. Median age was 68.6, 65.9, and 63.3 years, respectively (PÂ = .001). Right colon disease was significantly associated with intraperitoneal spread (PÂ &lt; .0001), while left colon and rectum disease preferentially metastasized to the liver and lungs, respectively (PÂ &lt; .0001 in both settings). A total of 636 patients (68.7%) received bevacizumab. Progression-free survival was superior for bevacizumab-treated patients in all groups but appeared greatest in right colon disease (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.60; PÂ â‰¤ .001). Overall survival was longest in patients with disease of the rectum, followed by left colon and right colon (median, 26.2, 23.6, and 18.2 months, respectively; PÂ = .0004). Tumor site appears to be prognostic in mCRC, with rectum and right colon disease associated with the best and worst outcomes, respectively. Patients who received bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy had superior outcomes, with the effect appearing greatest in patients with right colon disease.";"2017";"Clinical colorectal cancer";"Anti-VEGF therapy; Bowel cancer; Distal colorectal cancer; Personalized medicine; Proximal colorectal cancer; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Bevacizumab; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Registries; Treatment Outcome"

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 100 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed colorectal HGNEC diagnosed at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1991 andÂ 2013. In our cohort, most tumors (89%) were small cell carcinoma, and most (60%) involved the sigmoid or the anorectal regions. Sixty-four patients (64%) presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Striking epidemiological and clinical differences between those established in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and our cohort were noted, including significantly lower rates of smoking and lower risk of bone, brain metastases. Over 30% of the tumors were found associated with an adenoma. Median overall survival (OS) of the cohort was 14.7 months, with 2-year and 5-year OS rates of 23% and 8%, respectively. In patients with localized disease, multimodality therapy was associated with a trend toward improved median OS (20.4 vs. 15.4 months; PÂ = .08). Metastases at presentation (OS 20.63 vs. 8.7 months; localized vs metastatic disease at presentation; PÂ &lt; .001) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were strongly associated with a worse outcome. In comparison to SCLC, less than half of the patients with colorectal HGNEC have history of smoking; metastatic patterns are also different between the 2 cancers. Nevertheless, HGNEC also has an aggressive biology, with the rectum being the most common site of origin. For localized disease, a multimodality approach seems to be associated with better outcomes, while systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for advanced disease.";"2017";"Clinical colorectal cancer";"Colon; Metastasis; Rectum; Small cell carcinoma; Smoking; Survival; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies"

The former allows an extended lymph node clearance whereas the latter preserves the distal vascular supply via the left colic artery (LCA). Apical lymph node dissection of the IMA (ALMA) harvests nodal tissue along the IMA proximal to the LCA whilst performing a low ligation. This anatomically replicates the oncological benefit of high ligation and the vascular preservation of low ligation. Our study evaluates the nodal yield of ALMA and the short-term outcome of this technique. We retrospectively studied 19 patients with sigmoid or rectal cancer who underwent curative surgical resection with ALMA. All ALMAs were performed with a standard technique previously described (Kobayashi etÂ al., Surg Endosc 2005, 20:563-9; Sekimoto etÂ al. Surg Endosc 2010, 25:861-6) . The lymph node yield from the dissection (the ALMA specimen) was compared with the total lymph node yield. Data on the LCA anatomy, time required to perform ALMA, complications and postoperative recovery were evaluated. ALMA was successful in 18 patients. Median postoperative hospitalization was 5 (2-26)Â days without ALMA-related morbidity or mortality. The median lymph node yield was 20 (9-41) and a median of 14.3 (0-80)% were harvested with ALMA. Two patients not having neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy had fewer than 12 lymph nodes, excluding nodes harvested from ALMA. The average time required for ALMA was 18Â min.

This study enrolled a cohort of patients, who had received cetuximab treatment after two or more lines of chemotherapy for KRAS wild-type (exon 2 nonmutant) metastatic CRC, from the databases of Taiwan Cancer Registry (2004-2010) and National Health Insurance (2004-2011). Survival data were obtained from the National Death Registry. Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) and overall survival (OS) after the start of cetuximab treatment were compared between patients with LCRC (splenic flexure to rectum) and RCRC (cecum to hepatic flexure).

A 39-year-old woman underwent sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer during an emergency operation for pelvic peritonitis. The pathological finding was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Eleven months after the sigmoidectomy, a metastatic lesion was identified in the left ovary. Despite local radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, the left ovarian lesion grew, so resection of the uterus and bilateral ovaries was performed. Adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur-uracil (UFT)/calcium folinate (leucovorin, LV) was initiated. Seven months after resection of the ovarian lesion, brain metastases appeared in the bilateral frontal lobes and were treated with stereotactic Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Cervical and mediastinal lymph node metastases were also diagnosed, and irradiation of these lesions was performed. After radiotherapy, 10 courses of oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FOLFOX) were administered. During FOLFOX administration, recurrent left frontal lobe brain metastasis was diagnosed and treated with stereotactic Gamma Knife radiosurgery. In this case, the brain metastases were well treated with stereotactic Gamma Knife radiosurgery, and the systemic disease arising from sigmoid colon cancer has been kept under control with chemotherapies, surgical resection, and radiotherapy.

There are currently no published data on treatment outcomes for patients with metastatic hindgut NET. The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of clinicopathologic features, treatments and survival in hindgut NET patients. Among patients who were pathologically diagnosed with hindgut NET at Samsung Medical Center between March 2001 and February 2015, 607 were analyzed in this study. Hindgut NETs were defined as NETs that originated from the transverse and distal colon, rectum, and anus. Primary sites included 81 colon (13.3%) and 526 rectum (86.7%). According to the WHO classification, 578 patients (95.2%) had grade 1 NETs, 17 (2.8%) grade 2 NETs, and 12 (2.0%) had neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Forty-two patients (6.9%) had extensive disease, while the majority (93.1%, 565 patients) only exhibited localized disease. The 5- and 10-year survival rates of 565 localized NET patients were 98.1% and 95.3%, respectively. The median OS in 42 patients with extensive disease was 24.8 months (95% CI, 10.7-38.8). Among 565 patients with localized disease, the majority (484 patients, 85.7%) were treated with endoscopic procedure by gastroenterologists. For 42 patients with extensive disease, 17 patients were managed by supportive care, 3 by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), and 22 by systemic therapy. Among these 22 patients, 12 patients received only first-line therapy, 8 had second-line, and only 2 patients had third-line therapy. As first-line chemotherapy, the most commonly used regimens were etoposide plus cisplatin (Nâ€Š=â€Š7) and long acting octreotide (Nâ€Š=â€Š7). During treatment courses, the most commonly used regimen was long-acting octreotide. The median OS in 22 metastatic NET patients receiving systemic therapy was 19.3 months (95% CI, 3.2-35.3). Multivariate analysis in all 607 hindgut NETs patients suggested that the extent and the primary site of disease were significant independent prognostic factors for long term survival.

Because of data paucity, there is a tendency to extrapolate treatment from colon cancer, particularly in the adjuvant stetting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current surgical and adjuvant treatments of small-bowel adenocarcinoma and compare with colon cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study. The linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare database was used at a tertiary referral hospital. Patients with small-bowel adenocarcinoma and colon cancer identified from 1992 to 2010, using International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3 Revision, site, behavior, and histology codes were included. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and competing risk analysis. A total of 2123 patients with small-bowel adenocarcinoma and 248,862 patients with colon cancer were identified. Five-year overall survival rates for patients with small-bowel adenocarcinoma and colon cancer were 34.9% and 51.5% (p &lt; 0.0001). A total of 1550 patients with small-bowel adenocarcinoma (73.0%) underwent surgery, compared with 177,017 patients with colon cancer (71.1%). The proportion of patients who received chemotherapy was similar, at 21.3% for small bowel and 20.0% for colon. In contrast to colon cancer, chemotherapy did not improve overall or cancer-specific survival for patients with small-bowel adenocarcinoma, regardless of stage. Predictors of poor survival for small-bowel adenocarcinoma on multivariate analysis included advanced age, black race, advanced stage, poor tumor differentiation, high comorbidity index, and distal location. Chemotherapy did not confer additional survival benefit compared with surgery alone (HR, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.90-1.22)). This was a retrospective review. The reliance on Medicare data limited granularity and may have affected the generalizability of the results. The prognosis for small-bowel adenocarcinoma is worse than that for colon cancer, and only surgery improves survival. In contrast to colon cancer, a survival benefit from current chemotherapy regimens for small-bowel adenocarcinoma is not seen, suggesting that it may be overused and needs more rigorous study.";"2016";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cohort Studies; Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Ileal Neoplasms; Intestinal Neoplasms; Intestine, Small; Jejunal Neoplasms; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymph Node Excision; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program; Survival Rate; United States"

This study analyzed risk factors associated with ERP failure after laparoscopic colon cancer surgery. We analyzed the outcomes of 208 patients who underwent ERPs following laparoscopic colon cancer surgery between June 2007 and April 2013. The ERP included early oral feeding, early ambulation, and regular laxative administration. ERP failure was defined as postoperative hospital stay of more than 5 days related to postoperative complications, unplanned readmission within 30 days of surgery, or death. Surgical procedures included anterior resection (n = 101), right hemicolectomy (n = 90), and left hemicolectomy (n = 17). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.5 Â± 2.3 days (range 3-24 days).

Univariable analysis showed that ERP failure was associated with proximal colon cancer, side-to-side anastomosis, longer operation time, increased blood loss, and longer resected specimen length. Multivariable analysis showed that side-to-side anastomosis [odds ratio (OR) 4.534; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.902-10.811; P = 0.001] and increased blood loss (OR 1.004; 95% CI 1.001-1.008; P = 0.041) were independent risk factors for ERP failure. We showed that increased blood loss and side-to-side anastomosis in comparison with end-to-end anastomosis were independent risk factors associated with ERP failure after laparoscopic colon cancer surgery.

We aimed to investigate the number, size, and distribution of metastatic and nonmetastatic lymph nodes within the mesorectum; whether neoadjuvant therapy has any impact on the number and size of the lymph nodes; and the impact of metastatic lymph node localization on overall and disease-free survival. Specimens from 50 consecutive patients with stage II/III rectal cancer receiving either neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were investigated. Lymph node dissection was carried out by careful visual inspection and palpation. The localization of the each lymph node within the mesorectum and the relation with the tumor site were noted. The size and the number of lymph nodes retrieved decreased significantly with neoadjuvant therapy. Majority of the metastatic and nonmetastatic lymph nodes were located at or proximally to the tumor level and posterior side of the mesorectum. No relation was observed between the overall and disease-free survival, and the localization of the metastatic lymph nodes. Presence of lymph node metastases proximal to the tumor level has no impact on survival compared with the presence of lymph node metastasis only in the peritumoral region of the mesorectum. Although neoadjuvant therapy decreases the size and the number of lymph nodes, reaching an ideal number of lymph nodes for accurate staging is still possible with careful naked eye examination and dissection of perirectal fat. As the majority of metastatic and nonmetastatic lymph nodes are located in peritumoral and proximal compartment, and posterior side of the mesorectum, these regions should be the major interest of dissection.

Approximately 25% to 60% of CIMP tumors are microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) due to DNA hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter. Our aim was to determine if the distributions of clinicopathologic factors in CIMP-positive tumors with MLH1 DNA methylation differed from those in CIMP-positive tumors without DNA methylation of MLH1. We assessed the associations between age, sex, tumor-site, MSI status BRAF and KRAS mutations, and family colorectal cancer history with MLH1 methylation status in a large population-based sample of CIMP-positive colorectal cancers defined by a 5-marker panel using unconditional logistic regression to assess the odds of MLH1 methylation by study variables. Subjects with CIMP-positive tumors without MLH1 methylation were significantly younger, more likely to be male, and more likely to have distal colon or rectal primaries and the MSI-L phenotype. CIMP-positive MLH1-unmethylated tumors were significantly less likely than CIMP-positive MLH1-methylated tumors to harbor a BRAF V600E mutation and significantly more likely to harbor a KRAS mutation. MLH1 methylation was associated with significantly better overall survival (HR, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.82). These data suggest that MLH1 methylation in CIMP-positive tumors is not a completely random event and implies that there are environmental or genetic determinants that modify the probability that MLH1 will become methylated during CIMP pathogenesis.

This was a single-center retrospective study in which we examined the relationship between patient characteristics and prognosis in 161 stage IV CRC patients with indications for first-line systemic chemotherapy. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios (HR) for death, adjusted for clinical and pathological characteristics. Of the 161 patients recruited to the study, 83 had single-organ and 78 had multi-organ metastases. Median survival time was significantly shorter in patients with multi-organ metastases than in those with single-organ metastases (19.2 vs. 42.0 months, respectively; log-rank, P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in survival between patients with metastases in two versus three or more organs (log-rank; P = 0.368). According to univariate analysis, primary tumor sites in the left side of the colon and in the rectum, a pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen concentration of &gt;50 ng/mL, a well-/moderately differentiated tumor, and R0 resection of metastatic lesions were associated with better overall survival. According to multivariate analysis, left-sided location of the primary tumor [HR 0.414, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.216-0.815; P = 0.011] and R0 resection of metastatic lesions (HR 0.247, 95 % CI 0.04 0-0.834; P = 0.021) were independently associated with good prognosis.

No other definite mass shadows were detected. Positron emission (PET)-CT revealed high tracer accumulation (SUVmax) not only in the CT-identified lymph node, but also near the site of the anastomosis in the bowel. Considering that no tracer accumulation was detected at any other sites and the patient's compliance with medication and scheduled visits was poor, surgical resection rather than chemotherapy was adopted as the treatment strategy. No metastases other than at the sites identified by the diagnostic imaging were found during the surgery. Since the findings on palpation did not rule out the possibility that the nodule near the anastomotic site was present inside the intestinal tract, lymph node dissection, resection of the intestinal tract including the anastomotic site, and re-anastomosis were performed. The most likely diagnosis based on the histopathological findings was dissemination for both the adenocarcinoma and the nodule near the anastomotic site. At present, the patient is being treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. In the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) Guidelines for the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer, the recommended therapeutic intervention is surgical resection of hematogenous metastases; however, no treatment is specified for lymph node metastases. In general, chemotherapy is administered for distant metastases. However, we have found no reports of cases in which a complete remission has been achieved.

A total of 159 CRC patients who had undergone radical resection were retrospectively analyzed. Histopathological evaluation of tissue samples was conducted on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. PNI was considered positive when cancer cells were observed inside the nerve sheath, or when at least 33% of the nerve periphery was surrounded by cancer cells. A 3-tier grading system (PNI0, PNI1, PNI2) based on the depth of PNI was used to assess the localization of PNI in the bowel. PNI and other prognostic factors were evaluated by survival analysis. PNI status in CRC significantly affected postoperative overall survival (P&lt;0.001). The five-year survival rates for PNI-negative and PNI-positive patients were 77% and 32%, respectively. PNI was closely correlated with tumor gross type, tumor grade, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, vessel invasion, tumor budding grade, and tumor growth pattern. Multivariate analysis revealed that PNI was an independent prognostic factor (HR=2.223, P=0.003). The survival of PNI-positive patients was significantly poorer than that of PNI-negative patients in stages II and III (P=0.003 and P=0.008, respectively). The overall survival of colorectal patients was in the descending order of PNI-negative at stage II, PNI-positive at stage II/PNI-negative at stage III, and PNI-positive at stage III (P&lt;0.001). When the PNI status and T stage were considered together, overall survival curves of the PNI2 patients were significantly worse than those of PNI1 patients in pT4 stage (P=0.019). PNI is a poor independent prognostic factor for CRC. It could complement classic TNM staging classification in stratifying CRC patients in stages II and III.

She was further evaluated with CT of the abdomen followed by colonoscopy and biopsy, which revealed adenocarcinoma of the caecum with liver metastasis. The CS aortitis has a reported mortality of 100% if left untreated. Therefore prompt intervention and surgical debridement is recommended. Despite these recommendations, our patient had some delays in her treatment and did not undergo surgical debridement due to frailty.

Neoadjuvant therapy and total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer might be responsible in part for the differing effect of adjuvant systemic treatment on overall survival, which is more evident in colon cancer than in rectal cancer. Apart from anatomic divergences, rectal and colon cancer also differ in their embryological origin and metastatic patterns. Moreover, they harbor a different composition of drug targets, such as v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), which is preferentially mutated in proximal colon cancers, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is prevalently amplified or overexpressed in distal colorectal cancers. Despite their differences in metastatic pattern, composition of drug targets and earlier local treatment, metastatic rectal and colon cancer are, however, commonly regarded as one entity and are treated alike. In this review, we focused on rectal cancer and its biological and clinical differences and similarities relative to colon cancer. These aspects are crucial because they influence the current staging and treatment of these cancers, and might influence the design of future trials with targeted drugs.

The aim of the retrospective study is to explore the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of site-specific stage III colon cancers and the influences of tumor location on prognosis. Eight hundred ninety-five patients with stage III colon cancer treated with radical operation and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin) were divided into seven groups according to colon segment (cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, and sigmoid colon). Expression of excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) and thymidylate synthase (TS) was examined by immunohistochemistry. We assessed if differences exist in patient characteristics and clinic outcomes between the seven groups.

Sigmoid colon cancer (T3, N0, M0, stage IIA) had been diagnosed and treated by sigmoidectomy in October 1993. In December 2002, a liver metastasis with intrabiliary growth was found, and this was treated by extended right hepatic lobectomy and caudate lobectomy with extrahepatic bile duct resection. In February 2014, intrapancreatic bile duct metastasis was found, and this was treated by subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. The intrapancreatic metastasis was judged to have arisen from cancer cell implantation, either by spontaneous shedding of cancer cells or as a complication of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Twelve months have passed since the last surgical intervention, and there has been no sign of local recurrence or distant metastasis. Differential diagnosis between intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and intrabiliary growth of a liver metastasis originating from colorectal adenocarcinoma is difficult but very important for determining the therapeutic strategy. Careful examination is needed to diagnose intrahepatic biliary dilatation, especially for patients with a history of carcinoma in the digestive tract and even if years have passed since curative resection of the digestive tract cancer.

The increase in use of colonoscopy in national bowel cancer screening programmes combined with improved technology has resulted in a large increase in detection of polyps. Most polyps detected at screening colonoscopy are small (&lt;10 mm) or diminutive (&lt;6 mm) and, in particular the latter, have a very small chance of containing advanced features or cancer. The main reason for resecting small adenomas and sending them to histopathology serves to inform on the future surveillance intervals. Being able to diagnose adenomas in vivo would allow for them to be resected and discarded, saving the costs associated with histopathology. Diagnosing distal hyperplastic polyps in vivo would allow for these to be left in situ reducing the risks associated with polypectomy. There are now a number of new technologies that could potentially make optical diagnosis a reality.

However, treatment without surgery offers no possibility of cure, and furthermore, symptom control may be poor. We investigated the possibility of performing these resections under local anaesthesia in patients with a slim body habitus in a cohort of patients rejected for general anaesthesia. Eight patients (4 M, 4 F) aged 77-89 were included in this study. All had significant comorbidities and were deemed unfit for general anaesthesia by the consultant anaesthetist in charge of pre assessing high-risk patients. All patients had undergone a thorough assessment, which included P-POSSUM scoring. The recruited patients underwent a careful and fully informed consenting process, leading to standard cancer resections. These resections occurred between 2005 and 2012, under combined local anaesthesia and sedation. The operations undertaken were four right hemicolectomies (for caecal cancer), two Hartmann's procedures (for sigmoid cancer), one Hartmann's procedure with en bloc small bowel resection (for sigmoid cancer invading small bowel) and one transverse colectomy (for mid transverse colon cancer). Seven patients survived radical surgery without complications, although one died from an unrelated cause 8Â months after surgery. One of these surviving patients subsequently underwent CABG and further bowel surgery under GA 2Â years later for a metachronous sigmoid cancer. There was one postoperative death due to cardiogenic shock on the third postoperative day.

We did a prospective observational trial to assess whether high-dose radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy followed by observation (watchful waiting) was successful for non-surgical management of low rectal cancer. Patients with primary, resectable, T2 or T3, N0-N1 adenocarcinoma in the lower 6 cm of the rectum were given chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions to tumour, 50 Gy in 30 fractions to elective lymph node volumes, 5 Gy endorectal brachytherapy boost, and oral tegafur-uracil 300 mg/m(2)) every weekday for 6 weeks. Endoscopies and biopsies of the tumour were done at baseline, throughout the course of treatment (weeks 2, 4, and 6), and 6 weeks after the end of treatment. We allocated patients with complete clinical tumour regression, negative tumour site biopsies, and no nodal or distant metastases on CT and MRI 6 weeks after treatment to the observation group (watchful waiting). We referred all other patients to standard surgery. Patients under observation were followed up closely with endoscopies and selected-site biopsies, with surgical resection given for local recurrence. The primary endpoint was local tumour recurrence 1 year after allocation to the observation group. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00952926. Enrolment is closed, but follow-up continues for secondary endpoints. Between Oct 20, 2009, and Dec 23, 2013, we enrolled 55 patients. Patients were recruited from three surgical units throughout Denmark and treated in one tertiary cancer centre (Vejle Hospital, Vejle, Denmark). Of 51 patients who were eligible, 40 had clinical complete response and were allocated to observation. Median follow-up for local recurrence in the observation group was 23Â·9 months (IQR 15Â·3-31Â·0). Local recurrence in the observation group at 1 year was 15Â·5% (95% CI 3Â·3-26Â·3). The most common acute grade 3 adverse event during treatment was diarrhoea, which affected four (8%) of 51 patients. Sphincter function in the observation group was excellent, with 18 (72%) of 25 patients at 1 year and 11 (69%) of 16 patients at 2 years reporting no faecal incontinence at all and a median Jorge-Wexner score of 0 (IQR 0-0) at all timepoints. The most common late toxicity was bleeding from the rectal mucosa; grade 3 bleeding was reported in two (7%) in 30 patients at 1 year and one (6%) of 17 patients at 2 years.

We evaluated the relationship of PIK3CA mutation status in colorectal cancer with race/ethnicity, colorectal cancer survival, and other patient and tumor factors. This study comprised 377 racial/ethnic minorities with incident invasive colorectal cancer, enrolled in the Colon Cancer Family Registry via population-based cancer registries. Tumor specimens were tested for PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 and 20 hotspots, BRAF p.V600E mutations, and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). In logistic regression models, we evaluated the association between PIK3CA mutation status and race/ethnicity, overall, and by mutation site. Using Cox regression, we evaluated the association between PIK3CA mutation status and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 42 cases (11%), with a similar prevalence across racial/ethnic groups. Individuals with PIK3CA-mutated colorectal cancer were significantly more likely than those with PIK3CA-wildtype disease to have proximal colon cancer, MMR-deficient tumors, and a germline MMR mutation (P â‰¤ 0.01). There was no evidence for an association between PIK3CA and overall survival (HR, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-1.39). The prevalence of PIK3CA mutation status in colorectal cancer does not differ according to race/ethnicity, but may vary according to other relevant clinicopathologic and etiologic factors, including germline MMR mutation status, tumor MMR status, and tumor site.

Traditionally, perfusion is measured by assessing palpable pulses in the mesentery, active bleeding at cut edges, and lack of tissue discoloration. However, subjective methods lack predictive accuracy for an anastomotic leak. We used intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography to objectively assess colon perfusion before a bowel anastomosis. Seventy-seven laparoscopic colorectal operations, between June 2013 and June 2014, were retrospectively reviewed. The perfusion to the colon and ileum was clinically assessed, and then measured using the SPY Elite Imaging System. The absolute value provided an objective number on a 0-256 gray-scale to represent differences in ICG fluorescence intensity. The lowest absolute value was used in data analysis for each anastomosis (including small bowel) to represent the theoretical least perfused/weakest anastomotic area. The lowest absolute value recorded was 20 in a patient who underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for an adenoma, with no postoperative complications. Four low anterior resection patients had additional segments of descending colon resected. There was one mortality in a patient who underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. This study illustrates an initial experience with the SPY system in colorectal surgery. The SPY provides an objective, numerical value of bowel perfusion. However, evidence is scant as to the significance of these numbers. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to determine specific cutoff values correlated with surgical outcomes, specifically anastomotic leak rates.

Endocuff is an easy-to-use device that is attached like a cap to the distal tip of the colonoscope in order to optimize visualization behind the folds of the colon and increase the ADR. This is the first prospective study of Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy (EC) in a screening population with follow-up to determine the ADR and adverse events of EC. We prospectively enrolled asymptomatic patients referred for screening colonoscopy during the 4-month study period. We documented the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score, cecal intubation rate, polyp detection rate, ADR, number of advanced adenomas, and number of adverse events. Colonoscopies were performed by five board-certified gastroenterologists. During follow-up, the patients were called 4 to 12 weeks after EC. A total of 104 EC procedures were performed. Cecal intubation was achieved in 99â€Š% of the patients, with a median intubation time of 6 minutes. The polyp detection rate and ADR in our study were 72â€Š% and 47â€Š%, respectively, and 13.5â€Š% of the lesions were advanced adenomas. A significant number of adenomas were detected in the right side of the colon. Considering all the adenomas and hyperplastic polyps above the sigmoid, we recommended that nearly 60â€Š% of our patients repeat an endoscopic follow-up according to the existing Swiss guidelines. We noted no perforations or other serious adverse events, even in the patients with extensive diverticulosis. EC is feasible with the most commonly available colonoscopes without severe adverse events.

However, females over 65 years old show higher mortality and lower 5-year survival rate of colorectal cancer compared to their age-matched male counterparts. The objective of this review is to suggest gender-based innovations to improve colorectal cancer outcomes in females. Women have a higher risk of developing right-sided (proximal) colon cancer than men, which is associated with more aggressive form of neoplasia compared to left-sided (distal) colon cancer. Despite differences in tumor location between women and men, most of scientific researchers do not consider sex specificity for study design and interpretation. Also, colorectal cancer screening guidelines do not distinguish females from male, which may explain the higher frequency of more advanced neoplasia when tumors are first detected and false negative results in colonoscopy in females. Moreover, socio-cultural barriers within females are present to delay screening and diagnosis. Few studies, among studies that included both men and women, have reported sex-specific estimates of dietary risk factors which are crucial to establish cancer prevention guidelines despite sex- and gender-associated differences in nutrient metabolism and dietary practices. Furthermore, anti-cancer drug use for colorectal cancer treatment can cause toxicity to the reproductive system, and gender-specific recurrence and survival rates are reported.

Data on CRCs diagnosed in Italy from 2000 to 2008 in subjects aged 40-79 years were collected by 23 cancer registries. Incidence rate trends were evaluated as a whole and by macro-area (North-Centre and South-Islands), presence of a screening programme, sex, ten-year age class, anatomic site, stage at diagnosis, and pattern of diagnosis (screen-detected, non-screen-detected). The annual percent change (APC) of incidence rate trends, with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), were computed. The study included 46,857 CRCs diagnosed in subjects aged 40-79 years, of which 2,806 were screen-detected. The incidence rates in the North-Centre were higher than in the South and on the Islands. During the study period, screening programmes had been implemented only in the North-Centre and had a significant effect on incidence rates, with an initial sharp increase in incidence, followed by a decrease that started in the 3rd-4th years of screening. These incidence rate trends were exclusively due to modifications in the rates of stage I cases. After screening programmes started, incidence increased in all anatomic sites, particularly in the distal colon. The differential figures introduced by the implementation of screening programmes warrant a continuous surveillance of CRC incidence and mortality trends to monitor the impact of screening at a national level.

From January 2012 to December 2013, a consecutive series of 26 patients with low rectal cancer underwent laparoscopic taTME with coloanal anastomosis. cT4 or Type II-III rectal cancer (according to Rullier's classification) were contraindications to taTME. After anal sleeve mucosectomy, the rectal wall was transected at the ano-rectal junction. A single-access multichannel port was inserted in the anal canal. taTME was performed from down to up until the sacral promontory posteriorly and the Pouch of Douglas anteriorly were reached. A laparoscopic trans-abdominal approach was used to complete the left colon mobilization. Sixteen patients (61.5%) were male. The mean distance of the rectal cancer from the anal verge was 4.4 cm (range 3-6). Nineteen patients (73.1%) received long-course neoadjuvant radiotherapy. At final pathology, resection margins were negative in all the patients: the mean distal and radial resection margins were 19 mm and 11.2 mm, respectively. TME was complete in 23 patients (88.5%) and nearly complete in three. Postoperative mortality was 3.8%.

Current recommendations for asymptomatic populations begin screening at age 50 years, after which ~95% of cancers occur. Determinants that modify timing and frequency for screening include: personal/family history of adenomas or CRC, age of onset of lesions, and presence or potential to harbor high-risk conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), or Lynch syndrome. Although race, like family history, is heritable, it has not engendered inclusion in systematic screening recommendations despite multiple studies demonstrating disparity in the incidence and mortality from CRC, and the potential for targeted screening to reduce disparity. African Americans, when compared to Caucasians, have lower CRC screening utilization, younger presentation for CRC, higher CRC prevalence at all ages, and higher proportion of CRCs before age 50 years (~11 vs. 5%); are less likely to transmit personal/family history of adenomas or CRC that may change screening age; show excess of high-risk proximal adenomas, matched with 7-15% excess right-sided CRCs that lack microsatellite instability; show higher frequencies of high-risk adenomas for every age decile; and demonstrate genetic biomarkers associated with metastasis. These epidemiological and biological parameters put African Americans at higher risk from CRC irrespective of socioeconomic issues, like IBD, FAP, and Lynch patients. Including race as a factor in national CRC screening guidelines and commencing screening at an age earlier than 50 years seems rational based on the natural history and aggressive behavior in this population.";"2015";"Digestive diseases and sciences";"African Americans; Age Factors; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Mass Screening"

The number of metastatic lymph nodes has been positively correlated with the number of lymph nodes examined. Current guidelines recommend that at minimum 12 to 14 lymph nodes be assessed. In some studies, mismatch repair deficiency has been associated with lymph node yield. The purpose of this work was to determine whether mismatch repair-deficient colorectal tumors are associated with increased lymph node yield. We queried an institutional database to analyze colectomy specimens with immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair genes in patients treated for colorectal cancer between 1999 and 2012. Before 2006, immunohistochemistry was performed at the request of an oncologist or surgeon. After 2006, it was routinely performed for patients &lt;50 years of age. We measured the association of clinical and pathologic features with lymph node quantity. Fourteen predictors and confounders were jointly analyzed in a multivariable linear regression model. The study was conducted at a single tertiary care institution. Tissue specimens from 256 patients were reviewed. The correlation of tumor, patient, and operative variables to the yield of mesenteric lymph nodes was measured. Of 256 colectomy specimens reviewed, 94 had mismatch repair deficiency. On univariate analysis, mismatch repair deficiency was associated with lower lymph node yield, older patient age, right-sided tumors, and poor differentiation. The linear regression model identified 5 variables with independent relationships to lymph node yield, including patient age, specimen length, lymph node ratio, perineural invasion, and tumor size. A positive correlation was observed with tumor size, specimen length, and perineural invasion. Tumor location had a more complex, nonlinear, quadratic relationship with lymph node yield; proximal tumors were associated with a higher yield than more distal lesions. Mismatch repair deficiency was not independently associated with lymph node yield. Mismatch repair immunohistochemistry based on patient age, family history, and pathologic features may reduce the generalizability of these results. Our sample size was too small to identify variables with small measures of effect. The retrospective nature of the study did not permit a true assessment of the extent of mesenteric resection. Patient age, length of bowel resected, lymph node ratio, perineural invasion, tumor size, and tumor location were significant predictors of lymph node yield. However, when controlling for surgical and pathologic factors, mismatch repair protein expression did not predict lymph node yield.";"2015";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Biomarkers, Tumor; Brain Neoplasms; Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Mismatch Repair; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary; Prognosis; Risk Assessment; Statistics as Topic; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"

The PINPOINT Endoscopic Fluorescence Imaging System allows for intraoperative assessment of anastomotic perfusion. This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, clinical trial that assessed the feasibility and utility of FA for intraoperative perfusion assessment during left-sided colectomy and anterior resection at 11 centers in the United States. A total of 147 patients were enrolled, of whom 139 were eligible for analysis. Diverticulitis (44%), rectal cancer (25%), and colon cancer (21%) were the most prevalent indications for surgery. The mean level of anastomosis was 10 Â± 4 cm from the anal verge. Splenic-flexure mobilization was performed in 81% and high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery in 61.9% of patients. There was a 99% success rate for FA, and FA changed surgical plans in 11 (8%) patients, with the majority of changes occurring at the time of transection of the proximal margin (7%). Overall morbidity rates were 17%. The anastomotic leak rate was 1.4% (nÂ = 2). There were no anastomotic leaks in the 11 patients who had a change in surgical plan based on intraoperative perfusion assessment with FA.

From June 2011 to June 2013, 105 sigmoid colon and upper/middle rectal cancer patients underwent NS in our institution, involving one 5-mm port and three 3-mm ports, with the exception of an umbilical 12-mm port. A 10-mm scope is used through the umbilical 12-mm port, which will be extended to a small skin incision for specimen extraction. After dissection of the left colon, a 5-mm scope is inserted through the right lower 5-mm port and a linear stapler is inserted through the umbilical 12-mm port for rectal transection. The specimen is then extracted through umbilical incision, and the anastomosis is carried out by the double-staple technique. TNM staging is stage 0/I/II/III/IVâ€‰=â€‰0/31/32/31/11. Fifty-one patients underwent sigmoidectomy and 54 patients underwent anterior resection. There was no conversion to open surgery, but one patient required a change to a 5-mm port from one of the 3-mm ports. Mean operating time was 193 min and mean estimated blood loss was 12 ml.

We explored systematic differences in pathway activation and their clinical implications. Detailed clinicopathological data for 3045 colon carcinoma patients enrolled in the PETACC3 adjuvant chemotherapy trial were available for analysis. A subset of 1404 samples had molecular data, including gene expression and DNA copy number profiles for 589 and 199 samples, respectively. In addition, 413 colon adenocarcinoma from TCGA collection were also analyzed. Tumor side-effect on anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy was assessed in a cohort of 325 metastatic patients. Outcome variables considered were relapse-free survival and survival after relapse (SAR). Proximal carcinomas were more often mucinous, microsatellite instable (MSI)-high, mutated in key tumorigenic pathways, expressed a B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF)-like and a serrated pathway signature, regardless of histological type. Distal carcinomas were more often chromosome instable and EGFR or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified, and more frequently overexpressed epiregulin. While risk of relapse was not different per side, SAR was much poorer for proximal than for distal stage III carcinomas in a multivariable model including BRAF mutation status [N = 285; HR 1.95, 95% CI (1.6-2.4), P &lt; 0.001]. Only patients with metastases from a distal carcinoma responded to anti-EGFR therapy, in line with the predictions of our pathway enrichment analysis.

Macroscopic and microscopic surgical dissections were performed on 12 cadavers in the anatomy laboratory and on autopsy specimens. The dissections were recorded as video clips. Dissections were performed in accordance with the complete mesocolic excision technique on 10 male and 2 female cadavers. Vascular structures, autonomic nerves, and related fascias were shown. Within each step of the surgical procedure, important anatomical structures were displayed on still images captured from videos by animations. Three crucial steps for complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation are demonstrated on the cadavers: 1) full mobilization of the superior mesenteric root following the embryological planes between the visceral and the parietal fascias; 2) mobilization of the mesocolon from the duodenum and the pancreas and identification of vascular structures, especially the veins around the pancreas; and 3) central vascular ligation of the colonic vessels at their origin, taking into account the vascular variations within the mesocolonic vessels and the autonomic nerves around the superior mesenteric artery. The limitation of this study was the number of the cadavers used. Successful complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation depends on an accurate knowledge of the surgical anatomical planes and the vascular anatomy of the colon.";"2014";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Arteries; Cadaver; Colon, Descending; Colon, Transverse; Colonic Neoplasms; Dissection; Fasciotomy; Female; Humans; Ligation; Male; Mesocolon; Peripheral Nerves; Vascular Surgical Procedures; Veins; Video Recording"

Patients subjected to laparoscopic colectomy for carcinoma located at any site from the descending colon to the distal rectum from 2004 to 2010 were reviewed. Comparisons were made between cases with and without splenic flexure mobilization. A total of 229 patients were operated for left colon or rectal cancer. There was no difference with regard to the intraoperative bleeding and bowel perforation and no differences concerning the conversion rates. In contrast, stoma formation rates were higher in the mobilized group. Moreover, total operative time was higher for the mobilized group except for the middle rectum cancer cases. Postoperative outcomes as far as mortality and morbidity rates and primary hospital stay are concerned, did not display any difference.

However, it is difficult to dissect the anterior wall of the rectum from the adjacent organs. We herein describe a safe and useful ISR technique which draws out the rectum through the anus. The intersphincteric space (ISS) between the internal and external anal sphincter muscles was first transabdominally dissected. Next, the transanal dissection was advanced into the ISS bilaterally from the posterior side without dissecting the anterior wall of the anal canal, and the sigmoid colon and rectum were drawn out through the anus. Dissection between the anterior wall of the rectum and prostate/vagina could be easily performed under direct vision. This technique enables the dissection without any risk of a positive surgical margin or unexpected bleeding, and avoids injury to adjacent organs. This technique seems to be a safe and useful dissection technique for approaching the anterior wall of the anal canal.

The current study is the first to analyze in depth ITIH5 expression as well as its potential clinical and functional impact in colon cancer. Based on 30 tumor and 30 adjacent normal tissues we examined ITIH5 mRNA expression and promoter methylation, whose significance was further validated by independent data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) platform. In addition, ITIH5 protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. ITIH5 mRNA expression loss was significantly associated (P&lt;0.001) with hypermethylation of the ITIH5 promoter in primary colon tumors. In addition, treatment of tumor cell lines with demethylating (DAC) and histone acetylating (TSA) agents induced ITIH5 expression. In line, independent TCGA data revealed a significant expression loss of ITIH5, particularly in the MSI-high and CIMP-positive phenotype concordant with an increased ITIH5 hypermethylation in CIMP-positive colon tumors (P&lt;0.001). In proximal, i.e., right-sided tumors, abundant ITIH5 expression was associated with longer overall survival (OS, P = 0.049) and the CIMP-positive (P = 0.032) subgroup. Functionally, ITIH5 re-expression mediated a reduced proliferation in HCT116 and CaCo2 cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that ITIH5 is a novel putative tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer with a potential impact in the CIMP-related pathway. ITIH5 may serve as a novel epigenetic-based diagnostic biomarker with further clinical impact for risk stratification of CIMP-positive colon cancer patients.

Demographic and clinical data from the Florida Cancer Data System registry (2007-2011) were linked with Agency for Health Care Administration and US Census data (nâ€Š=â€Š47,872). Cox hazard regression models were fitted with candidate predictors of CRC survival and stratified by age group (18-49, 50-64, 65+). Stratified by age group, higher mortality risk per comorbidity was found among youngest (21%), followed by middle (19%), and then oldest (14%) age groups. The two younger age groups had higher mortality risk with proximal compared to those with distal cancer. Compared with private insurance, those in the middle age group were at higher death risk if not insured (HRâ€Š=â€Š1.35), or received healthcare through Medicare (HRâ€Š=â€Š1.44), Medicaid (HRâ€Š=â€Š1.53), or the Veteran's Administration (HRâ€Š=â€Š1.26). Only Medicaid in the youngest (52% higher risk) and those not insured in the oldest group (24% lower risk) were significantly different from their privately insured counterparts. Among 18-49 and 50-64 age groups there was a higher mortality risk among the lowest SES (1.17- and 1.23-fold higher in the middle age and 1.12- and 1.17-fold higher in the older age group, respectively) compared to highest SES. Married patients were significantly better off than divorced/separated (HRâ€Š=â€Š1.22), single (HRâ€Š=â€Š1.29), or widowed (HRâ€Š=â€Š1.19) patients. Factors associated with increased risk for mortality among individuals with CRC included being older, uninsured, unmarried, more comorbidities, living in lower SES neighborhoods, and diagnosed at later disease stage. Higher risk among younger patients was attributed to proximal cancer site, Medicaid, and distant disease; however, lower SES and being unmarried were not risk factors in this age group. Targeted interventions to improve survivorship and greater social support while considering age classification may assist these high-risk groups.";"2015";"PloS one";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Colorectal Neoplasms; Comorbidity; Female; Florida; Humans; Insurance Coverage; Male; Medicaid; Medically Uninsured; Medicare; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Young Adult"

Proximal and distal tumours exhibit different clinical, epidemiological, and biological characteristics. Improvement of the prognostic evaluation of CRC requires new molecular markers. Podocalyxin-like 1 (PODXL), an anti-adhesive transmembrane sialomucin, is associated with an aggressive tumour phenotype and poor prognosis. For colorectal cancer, it has been suggested to be a marker of poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PODXL in CRC by use of a novel monoclonal antibody. In 1983-2001, 840 consecutive colorectal cancer patients were treated at Helsinki University Central Hospital, of whom 767 were successfully scored for PODXL immunohistochemical expression from tumour tissue microarrays by use of a novel monoclonal in-house antibody. Associations of PODXL expression and tumour location with other clinicopathological variables were explored by Fisher's exact-test, linear-by- linear association test, and binary logistic regression. Survival analyses were done by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. PODXL protein expression was high in 44 (5.7%) specimens. High expression associated strongly with poor differentiation (p &lt; 0.0001), advanced stage (p = 0.011), and location of the tumour in the right hemicolon (RHC) (p &lt; 0.001). Tumours of the RHC were more poorly differentiated (p &lt; 0.0001) and showed higher PODXL expression (p &lt; 0.001).High PODXL expression associated significantly with higher risk for disease-specific death from CRC (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-3.06, p = 0.001) and also in the subgroups of left hemicolon (LHC) cancers (HR = 2.60; 95% CI 1.45-4.66, p = 0.001) and rectal cancers (HR = 3.03; 95% CI 1.54-5.60, p = 0.001).

Podocalyxin was an independent factor for poor prognosis in colorectal cancer and in the subgroups of left hemicolon and rectum. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence of such difference in PODXL expression, its function possibly being dependent upon tumour location.";"2015";"BMC cancer";"Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Sialoglycoproteins; Survival Analysis; Tissue Array Analysis"

This manuscript evaluated the literature concerning clinically relevant differences in the short and long-term course after laparoscopic or conventional resection of colonic cancer. An investigation of meta-analyses from randomized controlled clinical trials comparing laparoscopic and conventional surgery for colonic cancer was carried out. The incidence of intraoperative complications was higher during laparoscopic surgery, the duration of surgery was increased and blood loss was less when compared to open surgery. Overall morbidity and the incidence of surgical complications were decreased after laparoscopic surgery. General morbidity and mortality were not different after laparoscopic or open resection of colonic cancer. Duration of hospital stay was shorter but was also associated with the type of perioperative care (i.e. traditional or enhanced recovery). Following minimally invasive or conventional resection, the incidence of tumor recurrence (local and distant) and the duration of survival (overall and disease-free) showed no differences. Wound implantations were rare after both operative techniques but with a tendency to occur more often after laparoscopic than open resection. Laparoscopic resection of colonic cancer has clinically relevant short-term benefits for the patients and long-term results are not different from open colectomy. However, most of the patients included in randomized controlled trials underwent right or left colectomy and sigmoid or rectosigmoid resections.

The seven most common KRAS mutations in codon 12 and codon 13 were examined in 2,478 BRAF-wild-type tumors. Because KRAS mutations in codon 12 (n = 779) or 13 (n = 220) were not predictive of adjuvant cetuximab benefit, study arms were pooled for analysis.

All patients with non-metastatic LRACC treated with NCRT and multi-visceral resection (MVR) from January 2000 to July 2010 were included. The primary outcome was the rate of R0 resection (negative microscopic margins). Secondary outcomes were toxicities, post-operative morbidity and mortality, local recurrence, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Fifteen patients were identified. Nine primary cancers were located in the sigmoid and 4 in the left colon. Patients were treated with 45-50 Gy in 25 daily fractions and concurrent 5-FU infusion (225 mg/m(2)/day). En-bloc MVR included between 2 and 5 adjacent organs/structures. All but two resulted in R0 resection. One patient had a complete pathologic response and one had minimal residual tumour cells in the resected specimen. Post-operative major morbidity was 33.3%. No mortality occurred. At a median follow-up of 54 months, there were 2 local, 1 regional, and 2 distant lung recurrences. No grade 3 or 4 acute or late toxicities were observed. 5-year OS and DFS were 90.0% and 63.5% respectively. NCRT followed by MVR is a feasible option for the treatment of highly selected LRACC to achieve R0 resection, while maintaining acceptable treatment toxicity.

It is defined as a collection of pus that begins and extends through the iliopsoas muscle and can reach up to the inguinal region. We performed a retrospective descriptive study by reviewing medical records from the General Surgery department of Reina SofÃ­a's General University Hospital. Information was collected from patients diagnosed with psoas abscess who were admitted to the General Surgery department from 2006 to 2011. Five cases were reported for 6 years: four males (80%) and one female (20%). Average age was 51.6 years (range: 35--75). All were admitted to the hospital through the Emergency Department. Lumbar pain, fever and rash were clinical features in three patients. Two patients initiated with septic shock. Each patient had computed tomography performed, which confirmed the diagnosis. Causes of the abscess were as follows: one perforated colon neoplasm, two left hip osteomyelitis, one Crohn's disease and one primary abscess. Surgery was the treatment in three cases and placement of pigtail drainage was the treatment in two patients. Two patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and ultimately died. In our case series report, it is seen that treatment delay developed to septic shock and death. We should consider this entity in emergency practice in order to carry out timely treatment. Antecedentes: el absceso del psoas es una colecciÃ³n de pus que se localiza en el mÃºsculo psoas iliaco. Se produce por continuidad desde estructuras adyacentes o por diseminaciÃ³n hematÃ³gena; su etiologÃ­a es diversa. Objetivo: describir la atenciÃ³n ofrecida a los pacientes con absceso de psoas ingresados en un servicio de cirugÃ­a general. Material y mÃ©todos: estudio retrospectivo y descriptivo de pacientes ingresados al servicio de CirugÃ­a General y del Aparato Digestivo del Hospital General Reina SofÃ­a, Murcia, EspaÃ±a, entre enero de 2006 y febrero de 2012 con diagnÃ³stico compatible con absceso de psoas. Resultados: se reunieron 5 casos: 4 varones (80%) y 1 mujer (20%) con una media de edad de 51.6 aÃ±os (lÃ­mites: 35 y 75). Todos ingresaron al servicio de CirugÃ­a General desde Urgencias. La clÃ­nica fue: dolor lumbar, fiebre y enrojecimiento de partes blandas en 3 pacientes. Dos iniciaron con choque sÃ©ptico. A todos los pacientes se les realizÃ³ tomografÃ­a computada abdominal que confirmÃ³ el diagnÃ³stico. Las causas del absceso fueron: 1 neoplasia de sigma perforada; 2 osteomielitis de cadera izquierda; 1 enfermedad de Crohn, y 1 absceso primario. El tratamiento fue el drenaje quirÃºrgico en 3 casos, y colocaciÃ³n de pig tail bajo control radiolÃ³gico en 2 pacientes.

Whether this surgical approach provides extra months of life or instead leads to prohibitive post-operative morbidity and mortality has not previously been well characterized. This study was conducted to evaluate early and long-term outcomes for stage IV colorectal cancer patients with unresectable primary tumour. Patients with unresectable colorectal cancer who underwent palliative bypass or stoma creation were identified from a prospective colorectal cancer database. Early and long-term outcomes were evaluated. Survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. From 1980 to 2008, 81 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer had an unresectable primary or extensive metastases and underwent palliative bypass or stoma creation. Mean age was 61.5 Â± 13.9 years, 44 (54.3%) were male. Location of the colorectal cancer was left-sided in 82.7%. Of the patients, 38.3% had emergency or urgent surgery. Sixty-two (76.5%) patients underwent a diverting stoma, 15 (18.5%) underwent enteric bypass procedures and 4 (4.9%) had both a diverting stoma and proximal bypass created. Twenty-five complications occurred in 24 patients (29.6%) with 2 patients (2.5%) requiring further re-operation. There was no anastomotic leak. Mean length of hospital stay was 13.8 Â± 11.2 days. Thirty-day mortality rate was 16%. The median overall survival was 4.7 months, while the overall survival at 1 year was 24.7%. At 2 years, 6.1% patients were alive, all with a stoma. Palliative bypass or stoma creation is associated with survival for several months for a significant proportion of patients with stage IV colorectal cancers, who have unresectable primaries or extensive metastases.

Acrometastases can appear in patients of every age, with men being twice as likely as women to be affected. The most common primary cancer site is the lung (&gt;50Â %), followed by the colon, breast and genito-urinary tract. They mainly appear in cancer patients with wide-spread disseminated disease. Rarely, they may be the first presentation of occult silent cancer, mimicking a benign condition. Current evidence supports that the tumor cells reach the bones of the hands through the circulation and not the lymphatic system; the malignant cells from the lungs have an easy access through the arterial circulation of the arms. The rare incidence of foot acrometastases is believed to be due to the lack of red marrow in these bones, a further distance from the primary cancer site, and the valveless paravertebral venous plexuses (Batson's plexuses), which allow retrograde tumor cell embolization through the iliofemoral venous system. Treatment depends on staging and tumor extent. Amputative surgery is the more common approach, especially for cancers with poor response to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In the majority of cases, disarticulation of the ray is required to achieve wide margin resection. In the foot, amputation can be that of a ray, midfoot or transtibial, depending on the location and spread of the tumor. If unresectable, palliative treatment with radiation therapy, bisphosphonates and chemotherapy is recommended. The prognosis of the patients with acrometastatic cancer is poor; the mean survival time after diagnosis is &lt;6Â months. An exception seems to be the patients with renal cell carcinoma, if treated with radical surgical resection, and a long latency period between nephrectomy and metastasis has occurred.

Resection and anastomosis as one stage surgery would be prefered procedure. Anastomotic leakage, on the other hand, highly elevates risk of mortality and mobidity. The most important question is whether to, in resectable cases, perform primary resection with anastomosis or not. This study was retrospective and included 40 patients that have undergone emergency surgery for large bowel obstruction caused by cancer. According to whether resection and anastomosis was made at initial surgery or not, patients were grouped in group A (N = 18) and group B (N = 21), respectively. We have analysed the type of surgical procedure, days of hospitalization, mortality, anastomotic leakeage, wound infection and other postoperative complications. Our results show that there is no major difference in mortality and morbidity in these two groups, suggesting that for selected patients primary resection and anastomosis is a safe option of tratment with acceptable risk. Since there are no strict guidelines or scorring system which would point the tratment option the decision about the choice of procedure still remains the burden of surgeon and depends on its experience and subspeciality.

Treatment is usually palliative and consists of radiation or amputation. An 83-year-old woman was seen with pain and swelling of the right middle finger since 3 months. A radiograph of this finger showed a lytic lesion of the proximal phalanx. A metastasis, primary bone tumor, or osteomyelitis was considered. Because of a radically resected colon carcinoma in patient's medical history, the carcinoembryonic antigen level was analyzed and proved to be elevated. Computed tomography scan of thorax and abdomen showed 2 (primary) pulmonary tumors with mesenteric metastases. Patient refrained from further analysis and treatment of these lung tumors. However, because of persistent pain the right middle finger was amputated. Pathological examination of the finger confirmed the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma most likely to be a metastasis of lung cancer. Lung cancer is in most cases responsible for metastases in the hand. Acrometastasis may be the first manifestation of malignancy. Given the poor prognosis, early diagnosis is important to offer adequate treatment. Delay of appropriate treatment can adversely affect the quality of life in these often preterminal patients.

This technique was initially developed in neurosurgical practice and applied to extracranial lesions in the 1990s, and was termed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Studies have reported that the resection of distant metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) contributes to relatively long-term survival. However, the resection of pulmonary and liver metastases is not possible for various reasons. SBRT offers a therapeutic alternative to unresectable metastatic lesions. The present study describes three cases of distant metastasis from CRC that exhibited a complete response (CR) to SBRT. Case 1 is a 70-year-old man with recurrent liver metastases after surgery for rectal cancer with liver metastasis (S3: diameter 1.8 cm and volume 3.0 ml; S6: diameter 1.3 cm and volume 1.2 ml). Cases 2 and 3 were 65-year-old and 70-year-old men, respectively.

All cases were moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. No serious adverse side-effects were observed during the therapy.

RDUC affects a small subset of patients and is associated with chronic disabling symptoms and increased social/medical costs. Moreover, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC) carry an elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer and colonic mucosa high-grade dysplasia. Alternative medical strategies in steroid refractory disease are unlikely to provide durable remission in all patients, carry potential severe side effects and, as immunosuppressants, the risk of other neoplasms, and may increase the short-term complication rate when surgery is finally required. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (RP-IPAA) allows the complete removal of the diseased rectum and colon, virtually eliminating the risk of malignant transformation and reestablishing intestinal continuity with continence preservation. Since the introduction of this surgical procedure, morbidity and mortality rates have been drastically reduced. Despite the still notable rate of surgical complications, long-term quality of life assessment has shown excellent results in nearly all patients who have undergone RP-IPAA, comparing well with the general population. Furthermore, when performed for distal UC, RP-IPAA produces similar surgical outcomes with respect to pancolitis. In conclusion, RP-IPAA should always be considered in patients with RDUC, and multidisciplinary counseling should provide patients clear information about the advantages of surgery and possible complications as well as the chance to achieve disease remission with medical therapy.";"2015";"Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)";"Colitis, Ulcerative; Humans; Proctocolectomy, Restorative; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"

AL may be preceded by change in local metabolism and local ischaemia. Microdialysis of the peritoneal cavity is able to measure these changes in real-time and is minimally invasive. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to compare values of intraperitoneal microdialysis in patients with AL to patients without AL after open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Twenty-four patients underwent surgery for left-sided, sigmoid and rectal carcinoma with creation of an anastomosis. Intraoperatively a juxta-anastomotical intraperitoneal and subcutaneous microdialysis catheter was placed. The levels of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol in the dialysate were measured every 4 h during the first 5 post-operative days, and mean values and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. Mortality was 0 % and morbidity 38 %. In 3 patients (17 %), AL occurred. In patients with AL, post-operative peritoneal lactate level was 3.2 mmol/l (standard deviation (SD) 0.9) for patients without AL, compared to 4.4 mmol/l (SD 1.5) in case of AL (p = 0.03 for AUC). Intraperitoneal glucose levels were 8.1 mmol/l (SD 1.3), compared to 7.8 mmol/l (SD 2.2) in the complicated course (ns for AUC). Mean intraperitoneal lactate/pyruvate-ratio was 19.2 (SD 3) after colorectal surgery without AL compared to 25 (SD 4.7) in case of AL (non-significant (ns) for AUC). No significant differences were observed between patients who underwent laparoscopic resection and those who underwent open resection. Anastomotic leakage was preceded by a significantly higher AUC and mean value of lactate levels during the first 5 post-operative days.

A total of 143,747 patients undergoing segmental colectomy, hemicolectomy, anterior resection, or abdominoperineal resection (APER) for adenocarcinoma from 1995 to 2009 were identified from 13 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results regions. The primary end point was overall survival determined by adjusted hazard ratios (HRs); the secondary end point was lymph node yield. Total lymph node yield significantly decreased from proximal to distal resected segment in stage 0-II cancer, but not in stage III cancer. Lymph node ratio increased from cecum to hepatic flexure and then decreased distally (p &lt; 0.001). Adjusted HRs revealed that survival after right colonic resection for ascending hepatic flexure and transverse colon cancer was not significantly different from cecal cancer. Survival after left colonic resection for descending colon cancer was not different from splenic flexure cancer, but sigmoid colectomy carried improved survival (HR 0.95, p = 0.027). APER carried worse survival compared to anterior resection (HR 1.28, p &lt; 0.001) or right colonic resection for cecal cancer (HR 1.61, p &lt; 0.001). Survival after resection from colorectal cancer depends on specific anatomical segment and not just the division between colon and rectum, or left and right colon. This may be related to inherent differences in the anatomical characteristics of the particular colorectal segment, with varying lymph node yields contributing to understaging. This supports an individualized approach to colorectal cancer, with particular attention to surgical technique, leading to survival improvement.";"2014";"Annals of surgical oncology";"Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lymph Nodes; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; SEER Program; Survival Rate"

Very popular around mid twentieth century, P-T has had poor diffusion, mainly as a consequence of the technical simplifications brought by staplers. Recent literature seems poor on this specific topic, despite description of P-T appears in published series during the reconstructive phase of total laparoscopic protectomies. A comeback of P-T has also been observed as an option with deferred anastomosis, to allow and protect a colo-anal anastomosis in situations at greater risk of dehiscence, avoiding a temporary faecal diversion. After reviewing the most significant aspects of classic techniques of P-T, we report our experience with transanal laparoscopic P-T for distal rectal cancer, presenting a new, modified P-T with deferred anastomosis aimed at improving defecatory compliance. Between January 2008 and June 2011 we operated in 258 rectal cancers (0-14 cm from the anal verge), 62.79% of which by laparoscopic access (VL), with 218 restorative procedures (84.49%). The colo-anal anastomoses (CAA) were globally 68 (26.35%), of which 48 in VL procedures (70.58%). In 27 of these CAAs we utilised the P-T procedure, with immediate CAA (I-CAA) in 11 cases (all VL) and delayed CAA (D-CAA) in 16 (2 VL), by selective indications. All CAAs were manually fashioned; 6 D-CAA had the addition of a transverse coloplasty. Site of tumor was the lower rectum in 24 patients, with 21 patients receiving preoperative chemoradiation. There was no operative mortality. Early morbidity: DCAA: 3 pelvic abscesses with stoma formation. 1 intraoperative re-resection and colo-anal anastomosis with stoma formation for defective distal vascular supply. Late morbidity: anastomotic stenosis in 5/12 I-CAA and 4/14 D-CAA controlled by mechanical dilation. Function: 4/7 D-CAA and 4/6 I-CAA nearly complete functional recovery (Kirwan's 1 or 2).

The study analyzed 145 Astler-Coller B2 and C CRC patients. Genotyping for a variable number of tandem repeats and G to C single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'-UTR of the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene was carried out. TS genotypes were classified into high expression (high TS) and low expression types (low TS). High TS was found in 22.8% of patients. The right-side tumors were more frequently associated with high TS than the left-side tumors (p=0.024). High TS was only found in 9.3% of rectal tumors, but in 29.7% of colon cancers (p=0.0042). Disease-free survival after 20 months (DFS 20) was longer in subjects with low TS than in high TS (p=0.043). Patients who underwent chemotherapy had longer DFS 20 in the low TS than in the high TS subgroup (p=0.051). The low TS was found to be an independent good prognostic factor for DFS 20 in the whole group as well as in the subgroup treated with chemotherapy (p=0.024 and p=0.034, respectively). Patients with low TS did not show any differences in DFS 20 whether they were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or not.

This is a population-based prospective cohort study for cancer survival. This study was conducted within the Colon Cancer Family Registry, an international consortium. Participants were identified from population-based cancer registries in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Information on tumor site, microsatellite instability, and survival after diagnosis was available for 3284 men and women diagnosed with incident invasive colon or rectal cancer between 1997 and 2002, with ages at diagnosis ranging from 18 to 74.

Study limitations include the absence of stage at diagnosis and cause-of-death information for all but a subset of study participants. Some patient groups defined jointly by tumor site and microsatellite instability status are subject to small numbers. Proximal colon cancer survival differs from survival for distal colon and rectal cancer in a manner apparently dependent on microsatellite instability status. These findings support the premise that proximal colon, distal colon, and rectal cancers are clinicopathologically distinct.";"2013";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Australia; Biomarkers, Tumor; Canada; Colon; Colonic Neoplasms; CpG Islands; DNA, Neoplasm; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Microsatellite Instability; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum; Registries; Survival Rate; Time Factors; United States; Young Adult"

Bowel obstruction (BO) is a common complication of advanced abdominal cancer, including colon cancer, for which small, single-institution studies have suggested an incidence rate of 15% to 29%. Large population-based studies examining the incidence or risk factors associated with BO in cancer are lacking. To investigate the incidence and risk factors associated with BO in patients with stage IV colon cancer. Retrospective cohort, population-based study of patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare claims linked databases who were diagnosed as having stage IV colon cancer from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2005.

For the literature review, the Medline database (PubMed) was searched under the key words &quot;colorectal carcinoma AND gender&quot; and &quot;gender differences AND colorectal cancer&quot;. Publications of the last 9 years (2005-2013) were firstly retrieved. CRC is more commonly observed in men than in women, with the higher tumour risk for men being limited to the distal colon and rectum. Risk factors for the development of CRC include overweight and obesity, this relationship is more pronounced for men than for women. The extent to which gender is a prognostic factor for patient survival is controversial. A better survival of women compared to men is found especially in the younger age groups, from which can be derived a protective effect of oestrogens on the development of CRC. As for the frequency with which men and women undergo a screening of CRC, sometimes higher screening rates have been reported for men than women, however, the socio-economic status of persons invited to participate has much more influence on screening attendance than gender. An analysis of surgical procedures indicates that it is more difficult to perform the low anterior resection of the rectum in men than women, with the result that men managed by less experienced surgeons are more likely to receive abdominoperineal excision. Furthermore, the risk of anastomotic leakage is higher in men than women. The essential gender difference, however, is the longer life expectancy of women compared to men which has been not always clearly (risk adjusted) elaborated in the studies available so far. This difference alone can already explain at a high rate the poorer prognosis of right-sided colon cancers compared to left-sided cancers. Comparable levels of CRC risk are reached in women as compared to men at a higher age. This may influence the effectiveness of screening programmes and has not been sufficiently examined. Evidence suggests the adaptation of screening recommendations to this fact.";"2014";"Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie";"Adult; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delayed Diagnosis; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Female; Germany; Humans; Incidence; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Adjustment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Survival Rate"

Histopathologically, adenocarcinomas are mostly diagnosed. Mucinous and signet-ring cell subtypes occur with a very low incidence. However, these subtypes differ remarkably in terms of clinical, histological and molecular biological characteristics. The aim of this review is to present a detailed analysis of current knowledge regarding differences between classical adenocarcinoma and mucinous, and signet-ring cell CRC along with potential consequences for daily practice. For this report all articles with relevant information on differences between classical adenocarcinoma and mucinous, and signet-ring cell CRC found via Pubmed searches were analysed. Furthermore, findings of our previous study were included. Mucinous CRC occur with a reported incidence of 10 - 20 % in Western countries and are predominantly found in younger patients and females. They are more often diagnosed in the proximal colon and present with a higher stage at diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a higher rate of lymph node-positive tumours and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Results of molecular biological studies confirm that they may represent a different tumour entity. The response to well established chemotherapy regimens is poorer which may be attributed to the higher rate of microsatellite-instable tumours and an increased mucin secretion. The poorer outcome is likely related to the higher stage at the time of diagnosis. Signet-ring cell type CRC are rare with an incidence ranging between 0,9 % to 4 %. They are also more common in the right colon and are associated with a poorer outcome compared to adenocarcinoma and mucinous CRC. However, it should be noted that most of the results come from studies with a very low number of patients which can be attributed to the low incidence of mucinous and signet-ring cell CRC. Based on the findings of the present analysis, a more radical surgical approach should be considered providing that the exact preoperative histology is available. Furthermore, the histological subtype should be taken into account in future chemotherapy trials to avoid unnecessary therapy. A closer follow-up, especially for patients with signet-ring cell CRC should be discussed. In the near future, a more tailored therapy in patients with colorectal cancer would be highly desirable.";"2014";"Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie";"Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Carcinoma, Signet Ring Cell; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Genetic Markers; Germany; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Middle Aged; Mucins; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Sex Factors; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"

Small proximal polyps (prone to be advanced neoplasms) missed by colonoscopy are possible contributing factors. In this issue of AJG, the subject of polyp detection rates (PDRs) and adenoma detection rates (ADRs) in the proximal and distal colon is discussed by one group of investigators to address the issue of monitoring performance and to achieve improvement. The authors observed that these two parameters correlated well in segments proximal to the splenic flexure, but not in the left colon. They suggested that caution should be exercised when using PDR as a surrogate for ADR if data from the rectum and sigmoid were included. Avoidance of missed lesions at the time of colonoscopy may require new adjunct measures to enhance ADR. The impact of new adjunct measures on ADR is mixed. In contrast to water immersion, water exchange during insertion has consistently increased ADR during withdrawal inspection. Water exchange may be a suitable alternative platform to replace insertion by air insufflation in the evaluation of new adjunct measures of quality improvement to increase ADR. Payment reforms may be necessary to bring about inclusion of ADR reporting for monitoring of quality performance.";"2013";"The American journal of gastroenterology";"Adenoma; Colon; Colonic Neoplasms; Colonic Polyps; Colonoscopy; Female; Humans; Male"

To investigate whether young patients, i.e., under age 50, complain of symptoms for longer than older patients until the diagnosis of colon cancer is established. In this retrospective cohort study, patients were divided into two groups: &lt; 50 years old (group 1) and &gt; or = 50 (group 2). All had undergone surgery for left or right-colon cancer during the 10 year period of the study from January 2000 through December 2009 at one medical center. Rectal and sigmoid cancers were excluded. Data collected included age, geander, quantity and quality of complaints, duration of complaints, in-hospital versus community diagnosis, pathological staging, the side of colon involved, and overall mortality. The primary outcome was the quality and duration of complaints. Secondary outcomes were the pathological stage at presentation and the mortality rate.

This study was a retrospective analysis of data from the authors' prospectively collected colorectal surgery database. Between August 2009 and November 2010, 159 patients who underwent primary laparoscopic right colectomy at the Samsung Medical Center were recruited to participate in this study. Of these, 66 patients underwent SIL colectomy. The SIL and CL right colectomy groups did not differ significantly in terms of general characteristics including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American society of anesthesiology (ASA) score, previous abdominal operation, and diagnosis. The two groups also did not differ significantly in terms of perioperative complications (9.1 vs. 15.1 %, p = 0.335). Oncologic resection was similar in the two groups. The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 24 for SIL and 27 for CL right colectomy (p = 0.068). Tumor size, disease stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and proximal and distal resection margins did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean follow-up period was 24.5 for the SIL group and 26.4 months for the CL group (p = 0.098), with six recurrences in the SIL group (9.1 %) and three recurrences in the CL group (3.2 %) (p = 0.120). One death occurred in the CL group. Disease-free survival at 24 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (89.7 vs. 96.3 %, p = 0.120).

All patients were consecutively retrospectively enrolled to this study between January 2009 and February 2012 due to impending or prevalent complete malignant colorectal obstruction. TTS applicable uncovered nitinol SEMS with unique flexible properties were used (Taewoong Medical, South Korea). Left-sided obstruction (aboral from the left flexure) was compared to proximal (from the ileo-cecal valve to the left flexure) localization. All patients have been discussed in the interdisciplinary tumor conference and the recommendation to treat by endoscopic stent placement was given in consensus. A total of 15 patients was enrolled to this study (10 male and 5 female; mean age 68.3 Â± 15.4 years, range 48 - 94), five patients with obstructions located in the proximal hemicolon whereas ten patients had a left-sided malignancy. Technical success was achieved in all cases and there was no early complication noticed. Three late complications included tumor overgrowth (n = 1), stent occlusion (1), and dislocation (1). Stent-in-stent insertion achieved, again, clinical success. The site of SEMS implantation (proximal vs. left colon) had no impact on patient outcome or complication rate.

The liver is second only to the lymph nodes as the most common site for metastatic disease. More than half of the patients with metastatic liver disease will die from metastatic complications. Electro-coagulation is the coagulation (clotting) of tissue using a high-frequency electrical current applied locally with a metal instrument or needle with the aim of stopping bleeding. The object of this technique is to destroy the tumour completely, if possible, in a single surgical session. To study the beneficial and harmful effects of electro-coagulation compared with no intervention, to other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in patients with liver metastases. We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, and CINAHL up to December 2012. We included one randomised clinical trial that assessed beneficial and harmful effects of electro-coagulation and its comparators in patients with liver metastases, irrespective of the location of the primary tumour. We extracted relevant information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcome measures, and data on the outcome measures as well as information on the design and methodology of the trials. Risk of bias of the trials and data extraction was carried out by one author and checked by a second author. We included one randomised clinical trial that compared four groups: electro-coagulation alone, electro-coagulation + dimethyl sulphoxide, electro-coagulation + allopurinol, and control (Salim 1993). The risk of bias in the trial is high. In three groups, patients had their metastases destroyed with diathermy electro-coagulation (current set at No 5) and received: 1) solution of allopurinol by mouth 5 mL 4 x a day or 2) allopurinol by mouth 5 mL (50 mg) 4 x a day or 3) dimethyl sulphoxide by mouth 5 mL (500 mg) 4 x a day. In the control group patients received a solution of allopurinol by mouth 5 mL 4 x a day. The treatment was started in the fifth postoperative day and was continued for five years. Three hundred and six patients who had undergone resection of the sigmoid colon and who had five or more hepatic metastases were included; 75 received electro-coagulation alone (58 were evaluable), 76 received electro-coagulation plus allopurinol (53 were evaluable), 78 received electro-coagulation plus dimethyl sulphoxide (57 were evaluable), and 77 were in the control group (55 evaluable).The authors reported the number of deaths due to disease spread (100% in the control, 98% in electro-coagulation, 87% in electro-coagulation + allopurinol, and 86% in the electro-coagulation + dimethyl sulphoxide groups). There was a significant benefit in favour of the electro-coagulation + allopurinol (risk ratio (RR) 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.96)) and electro-coagulation + dimethyl sulphoxide (RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.95)) groups compared to the control group, but no such benefit in the electro-coagulation alone group (RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.02)) compared to the control group. There were no local recurrences, no positive tests for occult blood, and observed pulmonary metastases were always with ultrasonographic evidence of hepatic secondaries and were not significantly different for the experimental groups compared to the control group (electro-coagulation: RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.4 to 3.09)), electro-coagulation + allopurinol (RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.28 to 2.66)), electro-coagulation + dimethyl sulphoxide (RR 0.8 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.48)). None of the adverse events were significantly associated with treatment. On the basis of one randomised trial which did not describe its methodology in sufficient detail to assess risk of bias and quality, excluded 27% of patients after randomisation due to various reasons, and is probably not free from selective outcome reporting bias, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that in patients with colonic cancer liver metastases, electro-coagulation alone brings any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with the control. In addition, there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of adding allopurinol or dimethyl sulphoxide to electro-coagulation. The probability for selective outcome reporting bias in the trial is high. More randomised trials are needed in order to sufficiently validate electro-coagulation with or without co-interventions.";"2013";"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews";"Allopurinol; Colonic Neoplasms; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; Electrocoagulation; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Solvents"

Tumors were clinically classified as either T3 or T4 and by the N stage based on the presence or absence of positive regional lymph nodes. Patients received intensified combined modality treatment, consisting of neoadjuvant radiation therapy (50.4-54.0 Gy) and infusional chemotherapy (oxaliplatin 50 mg/m(2)) on the first day of each week, plus five daily continuous infusions of fluorouracil (200 mg/m(2) per die) from the first day of radiation therapy until radiotherapy completion. Patients received five or six cycles of oxaliplatin based on performance status, clinical lymph node involvement, and potential risk of a non-sphincter-conserving surgical procedure. Surgery was planned 7 to 9 wk after the end of radiochemotherapy treatment; adjuvant chemotherapy treatment was left to the oncologist's discretion and was recommended in patients with positive lymph nodes. After treatment, all patients were monitored every three months for the first year and every six months for the subsequent years. Of the 80 patients enrolled, 75 patients completed the programmed neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy treatment. All patients received the radiotherapy prescribed total dose; five patients suspended chemotherapy indefinitely because of chemotherapy-related toxicity. At least five cycles of oxaliplatin were administered to 73 patients. Treatment was well tolerated with high compliance and a good level of toxicity. Most of the acute toxic effects observed were classified as grades 1-2. Proctitis grade 2 was the most common symptom (63.75%) and the earliest manifestation of acute toxicity. Acute toxicity grades 3-4 was reported in 30% of patients and grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea reported in just three patients (3.75%). Seventy-seven patients underwent surgery; low anterior resection was performed in 52 patients, Miles' surgery in 11 patients and total mesorectal excision in nine patients. Fifty patients showed tumor downsizing â‰¥ 50% pathological downstaging in 88.00% of tumors. Out of 75 patients surviving surgery, 67 patients (89.33%) had some form of downstaging after preoperative treatment. A pathological complete response was achieved in 23.75% of patients and a nearly pathologic complete response (stage ypT1ypN0) in six patients. An involvement of the radial margin was never present. During surgery, intra-abdominal metastases were found in only one patient (1.25%). Initially, 45 patients required an abdominoperineal resection due to a tumor distal margin â‰¤ 5 cm from the anal verge. Of these patients, only seven of them underwent Miles' surgery and sphincter preservation was guaranteed in 84.50% of patients in this subgroup. Fourteen patients received postoperative chemotherapy. In the full analysis of enrolled cohort, eight of the 80 patients died, with seven deaths related to rectal cancer and one to unrelated causes. Local recurrences were observed in seven patients (8.75%) and distant metastases in 17 cases (21.25%). The five-year rate of overall survival rate was 90.91%. Using a median follow-up time of 28.5 mo, the cumulative incidence of local recurrences was 8.75%, and the overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 90.00% and 70.00%, respectively.

The reported incidence of symptomatic gastrointestinal metastases is 0.2-0.5%. Early diagnosis should be based on the observation of clinical symptoms and computed tomography (CT) imaging. In the present study, we describe the case of a 43-year-old male with a primary adenocarcinoma of the lung located in the lower right lobe. Following diagnosis, the patient underwent five lines of chemotherapy with a significant tumor reduction. Two years later, a mass located in the sigmoid colon was detected in the patient following a PET/CT scan. The clinical presentation was unusual with vomiting, headache, dyspnea and laboratory hyponatremia. A rare form of metastatic ulcerating adenocarcinoma was identified with colonoscopy, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical findings. A surgical approach was not performed due to the worsening condition of the patient. The patient demonstrated severe anemia and blood hypoxia, and one month later, the patient succumbed to disease.

An endoscopy demonstrated a 20mm Bormann 2 lesion with central ulceration located 20cm from the anal verge. A sigmoidectomy was performed. Histologically, the tumor deeply invaded the tissue and extended beyond the serosa, and was diagnosed as small-cell carcinoma. Cisplatin plus irinotecan was administered for adjuvant chemotherapy. Nine months after surgery, a follow-up computed tomography showed an enlarged lymph node behind the inferior vena cava and a 15Ã—8mm nodule located at the ventral side of the cecum. Under consideration of progressive disease, cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy was performed again using the same regimen. After nine cycles of cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy, a follow-up gastric endoscopy demonstrated external tumor invasion to the duodenum wall.

The aim of this study was to assess whether preoperative NLR could predict patients at risk of recurrence of CRC. All consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection for CRC over a 2-year period at our institution were analysed. Demographic data including CRC recurrence were prospectively collected from our institutional cancer database. CRC recurrence was diagnosed on radiological and endoscopic histopathological data. Preoperative NLR was calculated on baseline blood results, with a value &gt;5 being a poor prognostic factor. Parametric survival analysis was used to identify risk factors for CRC recurrence.

In these cases, emergency surgical decompression becomes mandatory as the traditional treatment option. It involves defunctioning stoma with or without primary resection of obstructing tumor. An alternative to surgery is endoluminal decompression. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of colonic stents, used as a bridge to surgery, in the management of malignant left colonic and rectal obstruction. We considered only randomized trials which compared stent vs surgery for intestinal obstruction from left sided colorectal cancer (as a bridge to surgery) irrespective of their size. No language or publication status restrictions were imposed. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Science Citation Index (from inception to December 2011) We identified 3109 citations through our electronic search and 3 through other sources. Initial screening of the titles and abstracts resulted in the exclusion of 3104 citations. A further 5 citations were excluded after detailed screening of full articles. Three published studies were included in this systematic review. A total of 197 patients were included in our analysis, 97 of them had colorectal stent vs 100 who had emergency surgery. Clinical success has been defined in different manners. In included trials the clinical success rate was significantly higher in the emergency surgery group (99%) compared with the stent group (52.5%) (pÂ &lt;Â 0.00001). There was no difference in the overall complication rate in the stent group (48.5%) vs emergency surgery group (51%) (pÂ =Â 0.86). There was no difference in 30-days postoperative mortality (pÂ =Â 0.97). The overall survival was analyzed in none trial. When used as a bridge to surgery, colorectal stents provide some advantages: the primary anastomosis rate was significantly higher in the stent group (64.9%) vs emergency surgery group (55%) (pÂ =Â 0.003); the overall stoma rate was significantly lower in the stent group (45.3%) compared with the emergency surgery group (62%) (pÂ =Â 0.02). There were no significant differences between the two groups as to permanent stoma rate (46.7% in stent group vs 51.8% in surgical group, pÂ =Â 0.56), anastomotic leakage rate (9% in stent group vs 3.7% in surgical group, pÂ =Â 0.35) and intra-abdominal abscess rate (5.1% in stent group vs 4.9% in surgical group, pÂ =Â 0.97). Although colonic stenting appears to be an effective treatment of malignant large bowel obstruction, the clinical success resulted significantly higher in the emergency surgery group without any advantages in terms of overall complication rate and 30-days postoperative mortality. On the other hand, the colonic stenting as a bridge to surgery provides surgical advantages, as higher primary anastomosis rate and a lower overall stoma rate, without increasing the risk of anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal abscess. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because few studies reported data on these outcomes. Due to the small and variable sample size of the included trials, further RCTs are needed including a larger number of patients and evaluating long term results (overall survival and quality of life) and cost-effectiveness analysis.";"2013";"Surgical oncology";"Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Rectal Neoplasms; Stents"

However, there is no evidence for the required length of this delay interval. In addition, there is a chance that a patient may die because postoperative chemotherapy was not started soon enough and a metastatic tumor was able to develop rapidly. We therefore conducted a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of an early start of chemotherapy after the resection of colorectal cancer with distant metastases. Five patients were enrolled. They received XELOX therapy (130 mg/m2 of oxaliplatin on day 1 plus 1,000 mg/m2 of capecitabine twice daily on days 1 to 14) on the 7th postoperative day and XELOX + bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg of bevacizumab on day 1) after the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy. Five patients underwent open surgery. The procedures included right hemicolectomy in 1 patient, sigmoidectomy in 2 patients, high anterior resection in 1 patient, and Hartmann procedure in 1 patient. All patients started chemotherapy on postoperative day 7. The median number of cycles of chemotherapy was 11 (8 to 22). No postoperative complications were observed. The tumor reduction rate was 44.3% (32.0 to 66.6%). Progression-free survival was 10.3 months. An early start of chemotherapy after surgery is feasible and safe. These findings suggest possible changes in the start time of chemotherapy after surgery in the future.

The quality measure may be described in terms: how well the screening test tells who truly has a disease (sensitivity) and who truly does not have a disease (specificity). This paper raises concerns about identification of the optimal screening test for colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy vs flexible sigmoidoscopy in colorectal cancer screening has been a source of ongoing debate. A multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing flexible sigmoidoscopy with usual care showed that flexible sigmoidoscopy screening is able to diminish the incidence of distal and proximal colorectal cancer, and also mortality related to the distal colorectal cancer. However, colonoscopy provides a more complete examination and remains the more sensitive exam than flexible sigmoidoscopy. Moreover, colonoscopy with polypectomy significantly reduces colorectal cancer incidence and colorectal cancer-related mortality in the general population. The article considers the relative merits of both methods and stresses an ethical aspect of patient's involvement in decision-making. Patients should be informed not only about tests tolerability and risk of endoscopy complications, but also that different screening tests for bowel cancer have different strength to exclude colonic cancer and polyps. The authorities calculate effectiveness and costs of the screening tests, but patients may not be interested in statistics regarding flexible sigmoidoscopy screening and from an ethical point of view, they have the right to chose colonoscopy, which is able to exclude a cancer and precancerous lesions in the whole large bowel.";"2013";"World journal of gastrointestinal pharmacology and therapeutics";"Cancer screening; Clinical competence; Colonoscopy; Colorectal cancer; Ethical aspects; Sigmoidoscopy; Standard of care"

SETTINGS, PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients diagnosed with anorectal melanoma from 1994 to 2010. Tumors were defined as anal, anorectal, or rectal melanoma according to their anatomic relationship to the dentate line. Clinicopathologic factors were compared by Ï‡2 test. Time-to-event analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of the 96 patients included (41 with anal melanoma, 32 with anorectal melanoma, 23 with rectal melanoma), patients with rectal and anorectal mucosal melanoma had advanced primary tumors (median Breslow thickness, 12 mm and 8 mm, p = 0.002), whereas anal lesions could be found at earlier depths (median thickness, 6.5 mm). Patients with anal tumors more commonly underwent transanal excision (p &lt; 0.02) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (p = 0.004) versus anorectal and rectal tumors. Patterns of recurrence were also distinct; nearly two-thirds of anorectal and rectal tumors recurred systemically, whereas anal melanoma more often recurred within the lymph nodes first (63%; p &lt; 0.02). Recurrence occurred in 24 (59%) patients with anal tumors, 23 (72%) patients with anorectal tumors, and 16 (70%) patients with rectal tumors.

In this study, detailed regional cancer registry data were used to quantify and explore the reasons for variation in colorectal cancer outcomes at nine hospitals in East Anglia. We analysed data on colorectal cancers registered by the Eastern Cancer Registry and Information Centre (ECRIC) between 1999 and 2005. Tumours were grouped by site, in keeping with surgical resection. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to identify the effects of patient, disease and treatment variables on an individual's risk of death. After adjusting for demographic, disease and treatment variables there were significant differences in survival among hospitals in emergency admissions with cancer of the right colon, in elective admissions with cancer of the left, sigmoid or recto-sigmoid colon and in emergency admissions with cancer of the rectum. There were also differences among hospitals in terms of perioperative death, nonsurgical management and numbers of nodes examined. For rectal cancers, rates of anterior resection compared with abdominoperineal excision differed, as well as the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Detailed analysis of demographic, disease and treatment factors are required when comparing the survival of individuals with colorectal cancer across hospitals.

Incidence rates for colorectal adenomas and advanced colorectal neoplasia are higher in men than in women of all age groups. The male-to-female ratio for CRC incidence rates differs for different parts of the large bowel. To summarize the current evidence on colorectal screening and prevention, focussing on potential differences in benefits between sexes and colorectal sites. , We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the impact of different screening approaches on CRC incidence and mortality, overall, for each sex separately, and for subsites of the large bowel. (ii) We reviewed studies comparing detection parameters for faecal immunochemical tests for haemoglobin (FIT) with guaiac FOBt (gFOBt). (iii) The role of aspirin in CRC prevention in the general population was reviewed using evidence from RCTs, with specific emphasis on the differences observed between sexes and lesion site. (i) Our intention-to-treat random-effects meta-analysis showed that once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening performed on average-risk individuals aged 55 + decreased CRC incidence by 18% and mortality by 28%, but sex-specific results were lacking. (ii) Modern quantitative FIT were superior to qualitative gFOBt in average-risk population screening in their ability to discriminate between individuals with and without colorectal neoplasia. Some recent FIT studies suggest varying operating characteristics in men and women. (iii) Evidence of an effect of aspirin on the incidence of CRC (in particular, proximal disease) in both sexes aged 40 and over at average-risk of CRC is emerging. We encourage researchers of CRC screening and prevention to publish their results by sex where possible. Pilot studies should be undertaken before implementation of quantitative FIT in a national screening programme to establish the appropriate threshold. Finally, individual risk assessment for CRC and non-CRC events, will be necessary to make an informed decision on whether a patient should receive aspirin chemoprevention.";"2014";"Journal of medical screening";"Colorectal cancer; aspirin; faecal occult blood test; flexible sigmoidoscopy; guaiac; immunochemical; screening; sex-specific; site-specific; Aged; Aspirin; Colorectal Neoplasms; England; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Occult Blood; Primary Prevention; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sex Distribution; Sigmoidoscopy"

Herein we conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy (HALC) with total laparoscopic colectomy (TLC) in the management of right-sided colonic cancer. Adult patients with carcinoma of the caecum and ascending colon were recruited and randomized to undergo either HALC or TLC. Measured outcomes included operative time, blood loss, conversion rate, postoperative morbidities, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, disease recurrence and patient survival.

However, the optimal stent design for colorectal use remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a double-wire woven uncovered stent for definitive palliative treatment of malignant colorectal obstruction. This study was a prospective, single-arm, observational clinical study of patients enrolled between December 2005 and September 2010. This study was conducted at a referral hospital in Japan. Twenty-four consecutive patients with malignant colorectal obstruction were included in the study. A double-wire woven uncovered stent was placed by use of a standard through-the-scope endoscopic placement technique. Technical, initial clinical, and long-term clinical success were measured. Long-term clinical success was defined as sustained relief of obstructive symptoms without reintervention until the patient's death. The Karnofsky performance status score before stent placement was 60 (median, interquartile range, 42.5-67.5). Twenty of 24 patients had primary colorectal cancer, and 4 had extracolorectal malignancies. The site of obstruction was the ascending colon in 10 patients, descending colon in 4 patients, sigmoid colon in 7 patients, and rectum in 3 patients. Technical, initial, and long-term clinical success rates were 100%, 100%, and 83%. Median stent patency time was 149 days (interquartile range, 45-198 days). Median survival time after stent placement was 155 days (interquartile range, 68-231 days). Four patients (17%) had negative outcomes including stent occlusion by tumor ingrowth (8%) and stent migration (8%). The highest Karnofsky performance status score after stent placement was 70 (median; interquartile range, 50-70). The Karnofsky performance status score improved after stent placement (p = 0.002).

Colorectal cancer (CRC) was the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men (n = 1063, 49.77/100,000), as well as women (n = 803, 34.89/100,000) in Croatia in 2009. The Croatian National CRC Screening Program was established by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and its implementation started in September, 2007. The coordinators were recruited in each county institute of public health with an obligation to provide fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) to the participants, followed by colonoscopy in all positive cases. The FOBT was performed by hypersensitive guaiac-based Hemognost card test (Biognost, Zagreb). The test and short questionnaire were delivered to the home addresses of all citizens aged 50-74 years consecutively during a 3-year period. Each participant was required to complete the questionnaire and send it together with the stool specimen on three test cards back to the institute for further analysis. About 4% FOBT positive cases are expected in normal risk populations. A descriptive analysis was performed. A total of 1,056,694 individuals (born between 1933-1945 and 1952-1957) were invited to screening by the end of September 2011. In total, 210,239 (19.9%) persons returned the envelope with a completed questionnaire, and 181,102 of them returned it with a correctly placed stool specimen on FOBT cards. Until now, 12,477 (6.9%), FOBT-positive patients have been found, which is at the upper limit of the expected values in European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in CRC Screening and Diagnosis [European Union (EU) Guidelines]. Colonoscopy was performed in 8541 cases (uptake 66%). Screening has identified CRC in 472 patients (5.5% of colonoscopied, 3.8% of FOBT-positive, and 0.26% of all screened individuals). This is also in the expected range according to EU Guidelines. Polyps were found and removed in 3329 (39% of colonoscopied) patients. The largest number of polyps were found in the left half of the colon: 64% (19%, 37% and 8% in the rectum, sigma, and descendens, respectively). The other 36% were detected in the proximal part (17% in the transverse colon and 19% in ceco-ascending colon). Small polyps in the rectum (5-10 mm in diameter), sigmoid and descending colon were histologically found to be tubular adenomas in 60% of cases, with a low degree of dysplasia, and 40% were classified as hyperplastic. Polyps of this size in the transverse or ceco-ascending colon in almost 20% had a histologically villous component, but still had a low degree of dysplasia. Polyps sized 10-20 mm in diameter were in 43% cases tubulovillous, and among them, 32% had areas with a high degree of dysplasia, especially those polyps in the ceco-ascending or transverse part. The characteristics of the Croatian CRC Screening National Program in the first 3 years were as follows: relatively low percentage of returned FOBT, higher number of FOBT-positive persons but still in the range for population-based programs, and higher number of pathologic findings (polyps and cancers). These results suggest a need for intervention strategies that include organizational changes and educational activities to improve awareness of CRC screening usefulness and increase participation rates.";"2013";"World journal of gastroenterology";"Colonoscopy; Colorectal cancer screening; Croatian National Colorectal Cancer Screening Program; Fecal occult blood testing; Uptake; Aged; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Croatia; Early Detection of Cancer; Feces; Female; Health Education; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Occult Blood; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Obstruction was defined by failure to trespass a colonic stenosis during endoscopy, by truncation of the contrast column during contrast enema, by severe colonic dilatation (cecum &gt;10 cm, transverse colon &gt;8 cm, descending colon &gt;6 cm) or by serosal tears. From 53 consecutive patients treated for malignant left-sided colon obstruction at our surgical department from July 2002 to July 2010, 19 patients had subtotal colectomy and 30 patients had segmental colectomy. Four patients were excluded: two of them had non-colorectal primary cancer and the other two had a two-stage procedure. The rate of severe colonic dilatation and serosal tears, the physiological severity score and the expected morbidity were higher in the group with subtotal colectomy than in the group of segmental colectomy (p&lt;0.05). However, the anastomotic leak rate was lower in the group with subtotal colectomy (0/19) than in the group with segmental colectomy (6/30) (p=0.042). Overall, there were no statistically significant differences regarding mortality or morbidity between the two groups. Despite worse preoperative conditions, patients who underwent subtotal colectomy for left-sided obstructing colonic cancer had a significantly lower anastomotic leak rate than those who underwent segmental colectomy. This fact supports the concept of subtotal colectomy for this entity. However, perioperative mortality seems to be independent of the presence or absence of an anastomotic leak.";"2012";"Anticancer research";"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies"

We also reviewed endoscopy-screening publications for prevalence of RS and proximal advanced adenomas (AAP) and having both or either. During 1980-2008, there were 64,559 CRCs registered; 31.6 % were RS cancer which has now decreased to 29 % of men's and 26 % of women's CRC (both P &lt; 0.01).

Some 50-57 % of screenees had both RS and proximal AAPs, least when aged 40-49 years at 25 %, women were 35 %, and with aging 40 %, but most in men at 70 %. With the changing CRC epidemiology, having fewer RS neoplasms but more proximal cancer, the effectiveness of FS screening for identifying significant neoplasms decreases with screenees' age and especially in females. These make FS screening less suitable for our aging and increasingly female population.";"2012";"Digestive diseases and sciences";"Adenomatous Polyps; Age Factors; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Incidence; Israel; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Sex Factors; Sigmoidoscopy"

We identified patients (cases) diagnosed with CRC age 70 to 89 years from January 1998 through December 2002 who died as a result of CRC by 2007. We selected three matched controls without cancer for each case. Controls were assigned a referent date (date of diagnosis of the case). Colonoscopy performed from January 1991 through 6 months before the diagnosis/referent date was our primary exposure. We compared exposure to colonoscopy in cases and controls by using conditional logistic regression controlling for covariates, stratified by site of CRC. We determined endoscopist specialty by linkage to the American Medical Association (AMA) Masterfile. We assessed whether the association between colonoscopy and CRC death varied with endoscopist specialty. We identified 9,458 cases (3,963 proximal [41.9%], 4,685 distal [49.5%], and 810 unknown site [8.6%]) and 27,641 controls. In all, 11.3% of cases and 23.7% of controls underwent colonoscopy more than 6 months before diagnosis. Compared with controls, cases were less likely to have undergone colonoscopy (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.43); the association was stronger for distal (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.27) than proximal (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.64) CRC.

Statistically significant variability in AL rate between centres was not observed, either before or after risk adjustment. Nonetheless, further improvement may be achievable in some centres by targeting the adjusted performance of better performing centres. These centres used neoadjuvant treatment, rectal irrigation, mobilization of the splenic flexure, resection of the sigmoid colon, side-to-end colo-anastomosis with or without pouch and defunctioning stoma at primary surgery in a significantly higher proportion of patients than less well performing centres.

Cancers located in both flexures were excluded. The surgical procedures included 39 extended right hemicolectomies, 11 extended left hemicolectomies, 5 transverse colectomies, and 3 total abdominal colectomies.

Eight patients developed minor complications postoperatively, but these cases were controlled conservatively without interventions. One patient was converted to an open procedure because of severe adhesions. There were no surgery-related deaths. The mean follow-up period was 40.5 months. There were no local recurrences during the follow-up period. Systemic recurrence developed in four patients: two in the liver and two with peritoneal seeding. The overall and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 84.6% and 89.3%, respectively.

The BT dosimetric planning method was chosen for each patient in each center according to the availability of the technique. This study describes the results for 705 out of 801 patients available for analysis. For the 2D arm, dosimetry was planned on orthogonal X-Rays using low dose rate (LDR) or pulsed dose rate (PDR) BT. For the 3D arm, dosimetry was planned on 3D imaging (mainly CT) and performed with PDR BT. Each center could follow the dosimetric method they were used to, according to the chosen radioelement and applicator. Manual or graphical optimization was allowed. Three treatment regimens were defined: Group 1: BT followed by surgery; 165 patients (2D arm: 76; 3D arm: 89); Group 2: EBRT (+chemotherapy), BT, then surgery; 305 patients (2D arm: 142; 3D arm: 163); Group 3: EBRT (+chemotherapy), then BT; 235 patients, (2D arm: 118; 3D arm: 117). The DVH parameters for CTVs (High Risk CTV and Intermediate Risk CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were computed as recommended by GYN GEC ESTRO guidelines. Total doses were converted to equivalent doses in 2Gy fractions (EQD2). Side effects were prospectively assessed using the CTCAEv3.0. The 2D and 3D arms were well balanced with regard to age, FIGO stage, histology, EBRT dose and chemotherapy. For each treatment regimen, BT doses and volumes were comparable between the 2D and 3D arms in terms of dose to point A, isodose 60 Gy volume, dose to ICRU rectal points, and TRAK. Dosimetric data in the 3D arm showed that the dose delivered to 90% of the High Risk CTV (HR CTV D90) was respectively, 81.2Gy(Î±/Î²10), 63.2Gy(Î±/Î²10) and 73.1Gy(Î±/Î²10) for groups 1, 2 and 3. The Intermediate Risk (IR) CTV D90 was respectively, 58.5Gy(Î±/Î²10), 57.3Gy(Î±/Î²10) and 61.7Gy(Î±/Î²10) for groups 1, 2 and 3. For the OARs, doses delivered to D2cc ranged 60-70Gy(Î±/Î²3) for the bladder, 33-61Gy(Î±/Î²3) for the rectum, and 44-58Gy(Î±/Î²3) for the sigmoid according to the regimen. At 24 months, local relapse-free survival was 91.9% and 100% in group 1, 84.7% and 93% in group 2, 73.9% and 78.5% in group 3; grade 3-4 toxicity rate was 14.6% and 8.9% in group 1, 12.5% and 8.8% in group 2, and 22.7% and 2.6% in group 3 for 2D and 3D arm. This multicentric study has shown that 3D BT is feasible and safe in routine practice. It has improved local control with half the toxicity observed with 2D dosimetry.

Differences between categorical outcome parameters were quantified using the RR and corresponding 95% CI. 44 studies and 222â€ˆ256 patients were included. The RR for proximal disease versus distal disease was 1.55 (95% CI 1.53 to 1.58). Mucinous differentiation was less frequent in male subjects (RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.94)). Interestingly, the prevalence of stage IV disease was similar in MAC and AC (RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.02)). Thirty-five articles were included in the survival analysis. A worse survival in MAC versus AC was demonstrated (HR 1.05 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.08)). Conversely, three out of four studies reported a better survival in MAC with microsatellite instability (MSI). Due to heterogeneity a meta-analysis on the effect of MSI was not possible. MAC more often originates from the right colon and is less frequent in male subjects. The authors did not identify a difference in the proportion of stage IV patients at presentation.

Using microarray data from 102 right-side colon carcinomas and 95 left-side colon carcinomas we show that different pathways dominate progression to relapse in right-side and left-side colon cancer. Right-side tumors at a high risk for relapse exhibit elevated expression of cell cycle control genes and elevated Wnt signaling. On the other hand, relapse-prone left-side tumors show elevated expression of genes that promote stromal expansion and reduced expression of tumor suppressor genes that initiate Wnt signaling. Single gene prognostic biomarkers are found separately for right-side and left-side disease. In left-side tumors with low expression levels of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) the 5-yr relapse-free survival probability is 0.89 95% CI (0.80-0.99), and in tumors with elevated NOX4 expression the probability is 0.51 95% CI (0.37-0.70). Right-side tumors with elevated expression levels of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) have a 5-yr relapse-free survival probability of 0.88 95% CI (0.80-0.96), and those with low CDX2 expression have a corresponding probability of 0.39 95% CI (0.15-0.78). Both NOX4 and CDX2 are much less prognostic on the opposite sides. This newly identified role of NOX4 in colon cancer is further investigated using the SW620 lymph node metastasis colon adenocarcinoma cell line and RNA interference. We show that NOX4 is expressed in the SW620 cell line and that application of NOX4 siRNA causes a significant reduction in reactive oxidative species production.";"2012";"Molecular carcinogenesis";"Adenocarcinoma; CDX2 Transcription Factor; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Male; NADPH Oxidase 4; NADPH Oxidases; Neoplasm Staging; RNA, Small Interfering; Recurrence; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Wnt Signaling Pathway"

Of the 189 operated patients, 110 met the inclusion criteria, 75 (68.2%) operated by open surgery and 35 (31.8%) by laparoscopic. The sigmoid colon was the most common site presented by neoplasia and rectosigmoidectomy was performed more by open colorectal resection (p = 0.042). The conversion rate was 7.9% (3/38). The patients were operated by open surgery in 81.5% of time less than 180 minutes (p &lt;0.001). In both pathways, the average number of removed lymph nodes was greater than 12, but laparotomy enabled, more frequently, the resection of 12 or more nodes (p = 0.012). No patient had surgical margins involved, but laparotomy allowed a greater number of patients with a margin greater than 5 cm from the tumor (p = 0.036). Increased number of patients treated by open surgery were hospitalized for more than seven days (p &lt;0.001). There were no statistically significant differences regarding the need for ostomies, complications and mortality. The laparoscopic approach was as safe and effective as laparotomy in the treatment of colorectal cancer, and was associated with increased operative time, shorter hospital stay and less morbidity.";"2013";"Arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian archives of digestive surgery";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colectomy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Rectum; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome"

Thirteen patients with vaginal cancer were treated with external beam radiotherapy (45-50.4 Gy) plus IGABT with or without chemotherapy. Distribution of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages among patients were as follows: 4 patients had Stage II cancer, 5 patients had Stage III cancer, and 4 patients had Stage IV cancer. The concept of IGABT as developed for cervix cancer was transferred and adapted for vaginal cancer, with corresponding treatment planning and reporting. Doses were converted to the equivalent dose in 2 Gy, applying the linear quadratic model (Î±/Î² = 10 Gy for tumor; Î±/Î² = 3 for organs at risk). Endpoints studied were gross tumor volume (GTV), dose-volume parameters for high-risk clinical target volume (HRCTV), and organs at risk, local control (LC), adverse side effects, and survival. The mean GTV (Â± 1 standard deviation) at diagnosis was 45.3 (Â±30) cm(3), and the mean GTV at brachytherapy was 10 (Â±14) cm(3). The mean D90 for the HRCTV was 86 (Â±13) Gy. The mean D2cc for bladder, urethra, rectum, and sigmoid colon were 80 (Â±20) Gy, 76 (Â±16) Gy, 70 (Â±9) Gy, and 60 (Â±9) Gy, respectively. After a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 19-87 months), one local recurrence and two distant metastases cases were observed. Actuarial LC and overall survival rates at 3 years were 92% and 85%. One patient with Stage IVA and 1 patient with Stage III disease experienced fistulas (one vesicovaginal, one rectovaginal), and 1 patient developed periurethral necrosis. The concept of IGABT, originally developed for treating cervix cancer, appears to be applicable to vaginal cancer treatment with only minor adaptations.

Recently, a robotic system has been attempted in CAA/ISR. By means of a robotic system, an excellent stereoscopic view may be obtained with high illumination, and adequate traction and countertraction can be easily performed in a narrow pelvis using the Endowrist function. During robotic CAA/ISR, although the robotic system is necessary to perform pelvic dissection that comes before the perianal approach, the huge robotic arms located in the low abdominal region could interfere with comfortable perianal dissection for the surgeon. Therefore, the robotic system has to be withdrawn and then set up again above the patient's abdomen, which is time-consuming. Moreover, this process also makes it difficult to maintain the aseptic circumstance of the robotic system. To address this problem, it is necessary to change the sequence of the procedure. Patients with low rectal adenocarcinoma located within 6Â cm above the anal verge were recruited and underwent robotic CAA/ISR. We performed the perianal approach first before docking the robotic system. In the transanal approach, manual dissection started at the level of the dentate line (for cases of CAA) or intersphincteric groove (for cases of ISR). The mucosa was stripped from the starting point to just above the levators. Robotic dissection was followed while maintaining pneumoperitoneum via packed gauzes in the anus. The surgical principles included high ligation of inferior mesenteric vessels and total mesorectal excision. Splenic flexure mobilization was selectively performed when the end of the remaining sigmoid colon could not reach the anal canal after the routine mobilization of the left colon side. After completion of total mesorectal excision, further dissection continued to the pelvic floor (Fig.Â 1). The puborectalis muscle sling was laterally exposed, and the anococcygeal ligament was noted on the posterior side of the anal canal. Intersphincteric dissection through the puborectalis ended at the intra-anal canal. Finally, the dissection plane could meet the perianal dissection plane. At this point, we could identify the gauze, which was packed via the perianal approach before beginning robotic dissection. The muscular rectal wall was divided by a cautery at the level of the puborectalis muscle by robotic arms. While performing the CAA/ISR, secure and meticulous dissection through the pelvic floor is important for oncological safety, which could be easily performed with the aid of robotic ergonomic Endowrist function and a magnified three-dimensional view even in a narrow pelvic cavity. Specimen extraction was done through the anus or additional minilaparotomy skin incision. In some cases, a planned ileostomy site was used as the minilaparotomy incision. For patients with bulky and heavy mesorectum, it is difficult and even dangerous to extract the specimen via the anus, which could induce traction injuries to the marginal vessels. Hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis was performed after removing the robotic cart from the operation field. The entire operative procedure is shown in the video. Early surgical outcomes, morbidity, and short-term follow-up data were extracted from a prospectively collected database. Robotic CAA/ISR for low rectal cancer was performed on 47 patients between August 2007 and December 2010. Forty-one patients underwent robotic CAA, and six patients underwent robotic ISR. There were 28 male and 19 female patients. The median age was 58 (range 32-86) years. The median body mass index was 23.3 (range 14.6-28.0) kg/m(2). Five patients (10.6%) had a history of abdominal surgery. According to American Society of Anesthesiology disease classification, 35 patients (74.5%) were class I, and 12 (25.5%) patients class II. The median distance between adenocarcinoma and the anal verge was 4 (range 1-6) cm. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was provided to 19 patients (40.4%). There was no conversion to laparoscopic or open procedure. Operation time for robotic CAA/ISR was 360.9Â Â±Â 128.5 (meanÂ Â±Â standard deviation) min. For specimen retrieval, transanal extraction was performed in 23 cases (49%) and minilaparotomy was created for 24 cases (51%), including three cases of planned ileostomy site. Protective ileostomy was performed for 37 patients (78.7%). Blood loss was 158.0Â Â±Â 236.5Â ml. The disease stage of the patients was as follows: stage 0, nÂ =Â 1; stage I, nÂ =Â 20; stage II, nÂ =Â 5; stage III, nÂ =Â 12; and pathologic complete response, nÂ =Â 9. Tumor size was 2.7Â Â±Â 1.5Â cm. The distal resection margin was 1.0Â Â±Â 1.2Â cm. The circumferential resection margins were positive in 3 patients (6.4%). The number of retrieved lymph nodes was 9.8Â Â±Â 5.8. The first postoperative bowel movement was observed on day 2 (range, days 1-5). The median diet consumption began on day 3 (range, days 2-21). The median hospital stay was 9 (range 5-30) days. There were 10 complications in the early postoperative period (21.3%): 3 anastomotic leakages (6.4%), 1 wound infection (2.1%), 5 pelvic abscesses (10.6%), and 1 postoperative ileus (2.1%). During the short-term follow-up periods (median 21.3Â months, range 3.5-40.7Â months), one local recurrence, three distal metastases, and one combined recurrence were observed. Two-year disease-free survival rate was 83.7%. Robotic CAA/ISR can be performed with good technical efficiency and acceptable morbidity. Further randomized, controlled studies assessing long-term survival, pelvic autonomic nerve function, and bowel function are needed before robotic CAA/ISR becomes widely accepted. Changing the sequence of the procedure, and thus performing the perianal approach before robotic dissection, may be a feasible method to avoid interference of the robotic system in the surgeon's moves using nonrobotic instruments while performing robotic CAA/ISR.";"2012";"Annals of surgical oncology";"Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anal Canal; Anastomosis, Surgical; Colon; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Rectal Neoplasms; Robotics"

The FCI flap is supplied by the cutaneous branch of the descending branch of the inferior gluteal artery. The sensory supply of this flap comes from side branches of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh. A total of 17 flaps were performed in 15 patients. Except for one, all flaps survived. One flap necrosis occurred because of false postoperative position with compression and tension to the vascular pedicle. In the remaining patients, we found one local cancer recurrence with necessity of a second flap from the contralateral side. The patients report satisfaction with reconstruction, without one having pain at donor site and recurrent vaginal ulceration.

Risk factors include positive lymph nodes and high grade tumors. Isolated metastases to the appendicular skeleton are very rare, particularly in the absence of identifiable risk factors. The patient was a 55 year old male with no previous personal or family history of colon cancer. Routine screening revealed a sigmoid adenocarcinoma. He underwent resection with primary anastomosis and was found to have Stage IIA colon cancer. He declined chemotherapy as part of a clinical trial, and eight months later was found to have an isolated metastasis in his right scapula. This was treated medically, but grew to 12 Ã— 15 cm. The patient underwent a curative forequarter amputation and is now more than four years from his original colon surgery. Stage IIA colon cancers are associated with a high five year survival rate, and chemotherapy is not automatically given. If metastases occur, they are likely to arise from local recurrence or follow lymphatic dissemination to the liver or lungs. Isolated skeletal metastases are quite rare and are usually confined to the axial skeleton. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an isolated scapular metastasis in a patient with node negative disease. The decision to treat the recurrence with radiation and chemotherapy did not reduce the tumor, and a forequarter amputation was eventually required. This case highlights the importance of adequately analyzing the stage of colon cancer and offering appropriate treatment. Equally important is the early involvement of a surgeon in discussing the timing of the treatment for recurrence. Perhaps if the patient had received chemotherapy or earlier resection, he could have been spared the forequarter amputation. The physician must also be aware of the remote possibility of an unusual presentation of metastasis in order to pursue timely work up.";"2012";"World journal of surgical oncology";"Adenocarcinoma; Colonic Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Scapula"

This difference in biological behavior for the three tumor locations has been also found in terms of sensitiveness, both pre- and post-operation, of tumor markers CEA, TPA, and CA19-9.

Out of the 136 patients, 118 grafts were transverse colon in clockwise peristalsis supplied by ascending branches of the left colonic artery. Twelve grafts were right part of transverse colon and ascending colon in clockwise peristalsis. Six grafts were left part of transverse colon and descending colon in counterclockwise peristalsis. All the 18 grafts were supplied by the middle colonic artery. The total perioperative complication rate was 26.4% (36/136), including anastomotic leakage in 15 cases, colon necrosis in 5 cases. The mortality was 12.5%(17/136), in which 5 patients died of colonic perforation, 4 died of colon necrosis, 4 died of severe lung infection after operation, 3 died of ARDS and 1 died of systemic infection of unknown origin. Anastomotic stenosis occurred in 2 patients, reflux in 2 cases, and 3 patients suffered from bowel dysmotility. Colon interposition is a complex procedure with significant trauma, high morbidity, and mortality. However, it is a valid alternative to reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract when the stomach is not feasible.";"2013";"Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery";"Adult; Aged; Anastomosis, Surgical; Colon; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagectomy; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies"

Prognosis of intestinal mucinous adenocarcinoma is reported to be poorer than that of non-mucinous adenocarcinoma.

The patients were matched for gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and type of operative procedure. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed for 33 RTME patients (80.5%) and 18 LTME patients (43.9%) (p=0.001). The mean operative time was 296 min for RTME and 315 min for LTME (p=0.357). The number of conversions were 3 (7.3%) for RTME and 9 (22%) for LTME (p=0.12). The anastomotic leak rate after surgery did not differ between RTME (n=3, 8.6%) and LTME (n=1, 2.9%) (p=0.62). The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 13.1 with RTME and 16.2 with LTME (p=0.07), and negative distal resection margins (DRMs) were noted in all surgical specimens. Positive circumferential resections (CRMs) were identified in 2.4% of the RTME cases and 4.9% of the LTME cases. No difference was noted in lengths of the DRMs, times until a liquid diet, or postoperative hospital stays. The total hospitalization costs were higher in the RTME group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no operative mortality or port-site recurrence in either group. For rectal cancer, RTME may be as feasible and safe as LTME in terms of technical and oncologic issues. Further prospective randomized trials are necessary for conclusions to be drawn concerning definite oncologic outcomes of robotic procedures for rectal cancer.";"2011";"Surgical endoscopy";"Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Case-Control Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Laparotomy; Male; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Complications; Proctoscopy; Rectal Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Robotics; Survival Analysis; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"

On the other hand, primary melanomas of the gastrointestinal tract are relatively uncommon. There are several published reports of melanomas occurring in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and anorectum. The occurrence of primary melanoma of the colon has, however, only been rarely reported. The optimum modus operandi for the management of primary colonic melanoma remains nebulous due to the limited number of reports in literature. A comprehensive search of Medline, Cochrane and Highwire was performed using the following keywords: 'melanoma', 'malignant melanoma', 'primary melanoma', 'colon', 'gastrointestinal tract', 'alimentary tract', 'digestive tract', and 'large bowel'. All patients with primary melanoma localized to the colon were included in the review. Patients with metastatic melanomas to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and primary melanomas localized to the GI tract in anatomic locations other than colon were excluded. There have been only 12 reported cases of primary melanoma of the colon to date. The average age of patients on presentation was 60.4 years without any significant gender predilection. Right colon (33%) and cecum (33%) were the most common sites for the occurrence of primary colonic melanoma while abdominal pain (58%) and weight loss (50%) were the most common presenting complaints. Colonoscopy is the most reliable diagnostic investigation and offers the additional advantage of obtaining tissue for diagnosis. S-100 and HMB-45 are highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of this malignancy. For primary colonic melanomas that have not metastasized to any distant parts of the body, surgical resection with wide margins appears to be the treatment of choice. Although the management was individualized in every case, most of the authors preferred traditional hemicolectomy as the favored surgical approach. Chemotherapeutic agents including interferons, cytokines, biological agents and radiation therapy for brain metastases have been reported as adjuvant and palliative options while considering malignant melanomas in general. The average recurrence-free interval was 2.59 years. Nine of the 12 reports documented follow-up in their patients. Two of these 9 (22.2%) patients died. Primary melanoma of the colon is a rare clinical entity. Whenever a seemingly primary melanoma is detected in an atypical location such as the colon, it is prudent to conduct a thorough clinical investigation to consider the possibility of metastatic disease. Further studies are needed to document the long term follow-up, survival advantage and safety of the management approaches employed in patients with primary colonic melanoma. Based on current data, surgical resection appears to be appropriate management for primary colonic melanomas; unless the disease has metastasized to distant sites where surgery may have a limited palliative role.";"2011";"World journal of surgical oncology";"Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Progression; Humans; Melanoma; Treatment Outcome"

The cause of obstruction varies between regions of the world. Current controversy concerns the surgical management of the acutely obstructed left colon. This is a prospective study of adult patients with acute large bowel obstruction over a 6-year period. The diagnosis of adult obstruction was made from a history of constipation, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, nausea, and radiographic features of large bowel obstruction. Laparotomy was performed on all patients after resuscitation. If the obstruction involved the right colon resection and primary ileo-colic anastomosis was performed, while for a lesion in the left colon a resection and primary colocolic anastomosis was performed after intraoperative antegrade colonic irrigation. If the obstructing lesions were thought to be malignant and too advanced to merit any excisional or the patient's general condition was too poor to withstand resection, a biopsy was taken and a decompressive bypass procedure given pending the confirmation of the diagnosis. The clinical course and postoperative outcome were carefully documented. A total of 50 patients aged 20-80 years, with a median age of 49 years, presented with features consistent with large bowel obstruction. Of these, 32 had simple sigmoid volvulus and were offered sigmoid colectomy and primary colorectal anastomosis, while 3 further patients with compound sigmoid volvulus had double resection with primary ileo-ileal and colorectal anastomosis. A patient with sigmoid volvulus had a Hartmann's procedure. Twelve patients had colon cancer, four had left hemicolectomy and primary colocolic anastomosis; three, sigmoid colectomy and primary colorectal anastomosis; three, low anterior resection and primary colorectal anastomosis; one decompressive colostomy and one, a right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis. The two patients with functional obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome) had tube caecostomy. All resections and primary anastomosis involving the right colon were preceded by antegrade on-table colonic lavage. One clinical anastomotic leak occurred in a low rectal anastomosis and minor wound infection in 10 patients. Operative mortality occurred in three patients with sigmoid volvulus. Adult large bowel obstruction is infrequent in our community and is caused commonly by sigmoid volvulus. Resection and primary anastomosis of the acute left-sided large bowel obstruction seems safe after antegrade on-table colonic lavage, provided bowel gangrene with peritonitis or any additional risk factor for anastomotic breakdown is not present.";"2011";"Annals of African medicine";"Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Anastomotic Leak; Colonic Diseases; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Laparotomy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult"

The Hartmann's operations are indicated for some ADRC when preservations of the sphincters is possible. An bloc of the parts from urinary system requires restoration of their integrity.

Spontaneous and chemically-induced CRC models are widely used yet limited in their resemblance to human disease and are often prolonged, not accurately repetitive, and associated with inflammatory side effects. In-situ murine or human tumor implantation in the gastrointestinal tract of mice is extremely challenging, and limited by inter-animal variability and procedure-related complications and mortality. As a result, in frequent studies CRC is implanted in distal sites, most commonly the subcutaneous region, an approach that is greatly limited by the absence of normal gastrointestinal tumor milieu and has substantial effects on tumor development. In this study we aimed to develop a well-tolerated repetitive tool to study CRC in small animals by adapting the murine colonoscopy system to serve as a platform for colonic sub-mucosal orthotopic implantation of human and murine CRC tumor cells. We report the establishment of a novel small-animal CRC model that is minimally invasive, rapid, well-tolerated, highly reproducible, and confers precise control of tumor number, location and growth rate. Moreover, we show that this model uniquely allows the side-by-side induction of distinct genetically manipulated tumors, enabling the mechanistic study of tumor interaction and cross-talk within the native intestinal microenvironment. Employment of this new approach may represent a major technical advance for the in-vivo study of CRC.";"2012";"PloS one";"Animals; Cell Proliferation; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Kinetics; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Transplantation; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"

Although many studies have examined the risk factors for anastomotic leak, large prospective series that report on long-term survival rates are lacking. Data of 1576 patients who underwent primary resection and anastomosis for colorectal adenocarcinoma at a single institution from 1984 to 2004 were prospectively collected. Anastomotic leaks (LEK) were classified as radiological (RAD), local (LOC), or generalised (GEN). Logistic regression analysis of 21 variables was undertaken. Overall survival, cancer-related survival, and disease-free survival were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Mean age of the patients was 67 years (SD = 12.5) and 834 (52.9%) were male. An LEK was more likely when relatively major gynaecological (tubo-oophorectomy, P = 0.004; hysterectomy, P = 0.006) or urological (total cystectomy, P = 0.014) procedures were performed during the same operative session.

A laparoscopic left colectomy was performed first, followed by a robotic right hepatectomy 10 days later. The left colectomy lasted 120 min with a negligible blood loss (&lt;10 mL). The right hepatectomy was completed robotically with an operating time of 330 min and intraoperative blood loss of 300 mL.

We followed up four randomised trials of aspirin versus control in primary (Thrombosis Prevention Trial, British Doctors Aspirin Trial) and secondary (Swedish Aspirin Low Dose Trial, UK-TIA Aspirin Trial) prevention of vascular events and one trial of different doses of aspirin (Dutch TIA Aspirin Trial) and established the effect of aspirin on risk of colorectal cancer over 20 years during and after the trials by analysis of pooled individual patient data. In the four trials of aspirin versus control (mean duration of scheduled treatment 6Â·0 years), 391 (2Â·8%) of 14â€ˆ033 patients had colorectal cancer during a median follow-up of 18Â·3 years.

Our study demonstrated significant disparities in survival by sex, race/ethnicity, and anatomic site. Across all time periods and among most cohorts, patients with proximal cancers had significantly worse survival outcomes. When compared to distal cancers, patients with proximal cancers were 13% less likely to survive 5Â years (OR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.91). When compared to non-Hispanic whites, blacks were 30% less likely to survive 5Â years (OR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.68-0.73). Stage-specific multivariable regression analysis of localized cancers demonstrated similar findings. Significant race-specific, sex-specific, and anatomic site-specific disparities in colon cancer survival exist. Proximal cancers are associated with worse survival odds. These disparities may reflect differences in the genotype and phenotype of colon cancer among these groups.

The CME along with the high vessel ligation, meaning the ligation of the supplying vessels close to their origin, can ensure maximal lymph node harvest. The principles of CME and high ligation have been applied by us during colonic resections for cancer. We present our experience with tumors of the proximal colon, for which a radical right hemicolectomy has been performed. Between 1989 and 2008, we performed a right hemicolectomy in 115 patients. The mean age was 65.6 years (range 35-86). The tumor was located in the cecum in 37% of patients, the ascending colon in 58% of the patients and the hepatic flexure in 5% of the patients. All patients underwent complete mesocolic excision and high ligation of the supplying vessels. A total of 93% (107/115) of these operations were performed on an elective basis. Out of all patients, 48 (42%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. No patient died during the immediate postoperative period. The postoperative morbidity was 13.9% (16/115). One patient developed a metachronous rectal carcinoma 28 months after his surgery, for which he underwent an abdoperineal resection. The 5-year survival rate lies at 72.4% (55/76). Twenty patients (26.3%) died due to metastatic disease before completing 5 years of follow-up. The remaining 39 patients have been operated after the end of 2004 and have therefore not completed 5 years from the day of their operation yet. There is no doubt that standardized oncologic surgery shows particular importance by reducing the rate of local recurrence and achieving increased survival. It is important to remember that colon cancer treatment today is multimodal and that the improvement in patients' survival in the last decades is surely linked with the improvement in chemotherapy and the advances in the agents used. However, optimal surgery is with no doubt an important element of good oncological outcome, as the experience with rectal cancer treatment has taught us.";"2011";"Techniques in coloproctology";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colectomy; Colon; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Ligation; Male; Mesocolon; Middle Aged; Survival Analysis"

Three hundred ninety-nine patients received neoadjuvant therapy, 65 received postoperative adjuvant therapy alone, and 163 were treated with surgery alone. Median follow-up was 5.8 years. On multivariable analysis, overall recurrence was associated with pathologic stage, lymphovascular invasion, and distal margin. Mucosal recurrence was uncommon; only 16 events were recorded, and of those only 8 were at the initial site of isolated tumor recurrence; 7 of the 8 were surgically salvaged. On univariable analysis, mucosal recurrence was associated with close distal margin (5 vs 2% at 5 y) and lymphovascular invasion (7 vs 2%). Pelvic recurrence, other than isolated mucosal recurrence, was associated with distal location (6 vs 4% at 5 y) and lymphovascular invasion (11 vs 4%). Distal margin as a continuous variable was associated with overall recurrence (excluding isolated mucosal recurrence). Close distal resection margin identifies patients with increased risk of mucosal and overall cancer recurrence.

For this report all articles with relevant information on differences between right- and left-sided colon carcinoma found via Pubmed searches were analysed. Furthermore, findings of a previous study performed by our group were included. Patients with right-sided colon cancer are significantly older, predominantly women, with a higher rate of comorbidities. Most of the large epidemiological studies reported a continued rightward shift of colorectal cancer. Histopathologically, carcinoma of the right colon show a higher percentage of poorly differentiated, locally advanced tumours with a higher rate of mucinous carcinoma and different pattern of metastatic spread. Survival is significantly worse in patients with right-sided carcinomas. There are numerous genetic differences which account for the distinct carcinogenesis and biological behaviour. The numerous findings regarding differences between right- and left-sided colon cancers should have an impact on colon cancer screening and therapy. Firstly, there are defined risk groups which should receive complete colonoscopy, particularly if they present with symptoms suspicious for colon carcinoma. Furthermore, location of the colon cancer should be considered before group stratification into genetic, clinical and especially chemotherapy trials. A more tailored approach to colon cancer treatment would be highly desirable if future trials further support the hypothesis of two distinct tumour entities.";"2011";"Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie";"Colon, Ascending; Colon, Descending; Colonic Neoplasms; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Survival Rate"

Obstruction predicted a worse DFS among patients with TNM stage II cancer (598 patients; log-rank test, p = 0.001; Cox regression, p = 0.012), but it was not a predictor in TNM stage III cancer patients (424 patients; p = 0.116; p = 0.108).

The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the long-term clinical success of SEMS in patients with malignant colorectal obstruction in a single tertiary center and to identify possible predictive factors of developing complications. A total of 47 attempts to insert colorectal SEMS were made in 47 patients during a 5-year period. Stents of 9-cm length were placed under endoscopic and radiologic monitoring. After 24 h, all patients underwent abdominal X-ray to verify correct positioning of the stent. Patients were followed at the outpatient clinic. Insertion success was achieved in 44 (94%) patients. Acceptable initial colonic decompression was observed in 44 out of 47 (94%) attempts and in all (100%) successfully inserted stents. The stents were placed in the rectum (n=7, 15%), sigmoid (n=33, 70%), left colon (n=4, 9%), or anastomosis (n=3, 6%). The majority of patients had stage IV disease (n=40, 85%). SEMS served as a bridge to scheduled surgery in 9 (20%) patients and as a palliative definitive treatment in 38 (80%) cases. Three patients were lost to follow-up, so the outcome was evaluated in 41 patients. Long-term clinical failure occurred in 21 (51%) patients and was due to complications such as: migration (n=9, 22%), obstruction (n=7, 17%), perforation (n=3, 7%), and tenesmus (n=2, 5%). Perforations occurred 3, 4, and 34 days after insertion, and all patients died. In the bridge-to-surgery group, primary anastomosis was possible in only four of nine patients (44%). Clinical failure was not associated with any tumor-related factor. However, eight of nine patients with stent migration and two of three patients with perforation had been previously treated with chemotherapy. Placement of SEMS does not seem to be as effective as suggested because of late complications.

Although Tyrian purple dye pigments and precursors from muricid molluscs are known for their anti-proliferative and proapoptotic activity, the chemoprotective properties of these edible molluscs has not been assessed. Enhancement of AARGC by oral administration of muricid extract (ME), containing a mixture of the cytotoxins tyrindoleninone and 6-bromoisatin, was assessed in an azoxymethane (AOM) rodent model. A dose-dependent increase in apoptotic index was observed in the distal colon, with a significant increase detected at an ME dose of 1.0 mg/g (p &lt; 0.01). Proliferation (PCNA) index failed to vary significantly at this ME concentration, which confirms the ME-induced increase in apoptotic response to DNA alkylation. ME also appears to confer no major toxic side effects, as all mice consistently gained weight during the trial and colonic crypt height was maintained (p &gt; 0.05) independent of ME dose. Although, this is the first example of AARGC enhancement by indole-based compounds, bioactive precursor degradation in simulated gastric fluid may prevent introduction of muricids as a chemopreventative food.

In this particular situation, the efficacy of en bloc multivisceral resection has been proven. When right-colon cancer invades the proximal duodenum or even the pancreatic head, a challenging dilemma arises due to complexity of the curative surgical procedure. Therefore, en bloc pancreaticoduodenectomy with right hemicolectomy should be performed to obtain free margins. The present study reports three cases of locally advanced right-colon cancer invading the proximal duodenum. All of these cases underwent successful en bloc pancreaticoduodenectomy plus right hemicolectomy, with no death occurrence. Long-term survival was observed in two cases (30 and 50 months). In the third case, the patient did not present any recurrence twelve months after surgical treatment. Multivisceral resection with en bloc pancreaticoduodenectomy should be considered for patients who present acceptable risk for major surgery and no distant dissemination.

The number and status of the nodes were prospectively assessed, and demographic and tumor-related variables were evaluated as risk factors for apical tumor invasion. Anastomotic leaks were also evaluated. A hundred and three patients (52 [50.5%] males, 60.3+/-12.9 years old) were included. The number of non-apical lymph nodes harvested was 14.5+/-7.1 with an additional 4.4+/-3.2 apical nodes at the high ligation site. Tumor invasion of apical nodes was observed in 6 (5.8%) patients. Two of these (1.9%) had no other positive nodes (skip metastases).

This study was performed to review the spectrum of surgery and early outcome of patients with acutely obstructed colorectal cancers. The secondary aims were to compare right- and left-sided obstruction and to identify factors predicting morbidity and mortality in these patients. A retrospective review of all patients who underwent operative intervention for acute obstruction from colorectal malignancy from February 2003 to April 2008 was performed. Patients were identified from the hospital's operating records based on postoperative diagnosis codes of colorectal malignancy. The diagnosis of acute obstruction was confirmed through clinical assessment, radiological investigations, and surgical findings. All the complications were graded according to the classification proposed by Clavien and group. Out of a total of 1,268 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal malignancy, 134 (10.6%) patients with a median age of 71 years (range, 34-97 years) were operated for acute obstruction. Left-sided malignancy accounted for 79.9% of the obstruction, with sigmoid colon being the most common site in 54 (40.3%) patients. A significant proportion (77.6%) of our patients had associated perioperative morbidity, and the mortality rate was 11.9%. Worse complications (grades of complications III to V) were more frequent in patients who had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (3-4), are &gt; or = 60 years old, and had preoperative renal impairment. Stoma was created more frequently in left-sided pathology. In an Asian population, surgery in patients with acute colorectal malignant obstruction is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Though left-sided malignant obstruction occurs more frequently and is associated with a higher incidence of stoma creation, primary resection and anastomosis is a safe option in selected patients.";"2010";"Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Colectomy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Colostomy; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stents; Treatment Outcome"

A statewide cross-sectional study was conducted among 3287 participants in screening colonoscopy between May 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007, from the state of Saarland in Germany who were aged 55 years or older. Prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasms was ascertained by screening colonoscopy and histopathologic examination of any polyps excised. Previous colonoscopy history was obtained by standardized questionnaire, and its association with prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasms was estimated, after adjustment for potential confounding factors by log-binomial regression. Advanced colorectal neoplasms were detected in 308 (11.4%) of the 2701 participants with no previous colonoscopy compared with 36 (6.1%) of the 586 participants who had undergone colonoscopy within the preceding 10 years.

This cross sectional survey covered 856 polypectomies in 716 patients, with anatomical distribution, size and histopathology of the polyps described in 2004-2009 in the educational hospital of Taleghani in Tehran.

This study showed a significant number of adenomas and carcinomas to lie proximal to the splenic flexure. Thus, it is expected that examination of the colon limited to the splenic flexure would miss 44% of such lesions.

Although this incision is smaller than that for open laparotomy incision, it may reduce the advantages of laparoscopic surgery. In totally laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, intracorporeal anastomosis is technically difficult. A safe and simple technique for circularly stapled intracorporeal anastomosis is described. After mobilization of the colon and division of the mesentery, a semicircumferential colotomy is made at the anterior colonic wall just proximal to the transection site. The anvil of a circular stapling device, secured with a Prolene suture, is introduced via the colotomy. The suture is advanced anteriorly so that the center rod of the circular stapling device penetrates the colonic wall. The colon is staple-transected at this point to secure the anvil on the proximal colon. A grasping forceps is brought through the rectum, and the specimen is extracted through the colotomy made at the distal staple line. After the colotomy is reclosed with a linear stapler, anastomosis is established using a hemidouble stapling technique. Totally laparoscopic sigmoid colectomies were performed for 16 patients with colon cancers. All the patients were treated laparoscopically without any complications. The average operation time was 180 min. Although one patient experienced wound infection, no major complications occurred. There was no mortality in this series. The procedure of totally intracorporeal anastomosis combined with transanal extraction of the specimen can be performed easily, enabling surgeons to achieve minimal invasiveness comparable with that of hybrid natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).";"2010";"Surgical endoscopy";"Anastomosis, Surgical; Colectomy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Neoplasm Staging; Pain, Postoperative; Patient Satisfaction; Risk Assessment; Safety Management; Sampling Studies; Sigmoid Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome"

Due to their rarity, the characteristics and behavior of this unusual malignancy remain unclear. To review the clinicopathologic features of patients operated on carcinoid tumors of the colon. Twenty-three patients (12 males and 11 females) were operated on colonic carcinoids. The mean age of the patients was 63.0 +/- 12.9 years (42 to 85 years). The clinical and histopathological data of patients who were pathologically diagnosed as having carcinoid tumors and submitted to surgical treatment over a 30-year period (1977-2007) were gathered. Actuarial patient survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with carcinoid-specific death as the outcome. The mean time elapsed between onset of symptoms and surgical treatment was 8.3 months (1.5 to 20 months). The most frequent symptoms or signs encountered were abdominal pain followed by anorexia or weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal tenderness, palpable abdominal mass, and rectal bleeding. No carcinoid syndrome was noted. The lesion was located in the cecum in 16 (69.6%) patients, in the sigmoid in 3 patients (13.0%), in the ascending colon in 3 patients (13.0%), and in the transverse colon in one patient (4.3%). Twenty-one (91.3%) patients were operated on curative intent. Spreading of the disease to the liver and peritoneum was found in two (8.7%) patients who submitted to intestinal bypass. The mean size of the largest mass was 3.7 +/- 1.2 cm (1.5 to 6.2 cm). There were multiple (two or more) lesions in three cases (13.0%). In the resected cases, the lymph nodes were compromised in 10 patients (47.6%) and disease-free in 11 (52.4%). Venous invasion and neural infiltration were both present in five (23.8%) patients. The tumors had penetrated the muscularis propria in all resected cases. Four (17.4%) patients had a second non-carcinoid primary tumor. Three (13.0%) patients died due to postoperative complications and five (21.7%) patients died from metachronous metastases or local recurrence. Fifteen patients (65.2%) remain alive without evidence of active disease. The mean follow-up period was 12 years (1.2 to 18 years), whereas the mean global survival was 50.7 +/- 34.2 months and the crude survival rate at 5 years was 62.7%. Carcinoid tumors of the colon are frequently right-sided and may be clinically occult until an advanced stage is reached. Based on the relatively poor survival rates reported, it is recommended that, in addition to standard surgical resection, vigorous surveillance for metastatic disease must be performed, particularly during the first 2 years after surgery. In addition, these patients require evaluation of the entire gastrointestinal tract for evidence of coexisting malignancy, along with an extended period of follow-up, because tumor recurrences after 5 years are not uncommon.";"2010";"Arquivos de gastroenterologia";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoid Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local"

Under more difficult circumstances with gross distension of the proximal colon many surgeons will decide to defer anastomosis. Hartmann's procedure still represents a valid treatment option. We describe our experience with primary resection and side-to-end anastomosis next to an end-colostomy in the management of acute malignant obstruction of the left bowel. The surgical procedure involves resection of the tumour and primary stapled side-to-end anastomosis next to a protecting end-colostomy. This type of enterostomy was first described by Santulli and Blanc in 1961. Colostomy closure is possible via a local procedure avoiding relaparotomy. Ten patients (five women) underwent surgery using this technique. Their mean age was 71 years (range 54-88 years). All patients had a massively distended colon. All obstructing lesions were biopsy-proven adenocarcinomas. There was no postoperative mortality and no anastomotic leakage. The colostomy could be closed without a laparotomy in all patients. The only two complications were one superficial necrosis of the stoma and one wound infection after colostomy closure. In all other patients the postoperative course was uneventful. Wound infection after colostomy closure was seen in the very first patient in whom the wound was closed primarily. In subsequent patients the skin was left open. The concept of an end-colostomy next to the anastomosis is an alternative approach combining the safety of proximal decompression and the advantages of primary anastomosis. This technique may be considered in patients presenting with a massively distended and faeces-loaded colon caused by an obstructing tumour in the descending or sigmoid colon, when the surgeon would otherwise elect to defer anastomosis.";"2009";"Techniques in coloproctology";"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Carcinoma; Cohort Studies; Colectomy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Colostomy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies"

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all CRC and right-sided CRC (cecum, ascending colon, and hepatic flexure) were calculated to compare the observed CRC incidence with that expected in the general population. Stratified analysis was performed to determine the risk at different follow-up time intervals, age at breast cancer diagnosis, and for tamoxifen use. There were 23,377 cases of breast cancer diagnosed between 1956 and 2006 with a total follow-up of 221,364 patient-years. The SIR for all CRC was 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.06) and for right-sided CRC it was 1.02 (95% CI 0.87-1.20). The SIRs remained close to unity at different time intervals, for different age groups, and in analysis restricted to more recent years (1985-2006). Tamoxifen use did not alter the risk of all CRC (SIR 1.22; 95% CI 0.92-1.62) or right-sided CRC (SIR 0.90; 95% CI 0.48-1.54).

When these lesions are large, safely resecting them often presents a significant technical challenge, with the possibility of resultant morbidity and mortality. We describe a technique derived from our experience with multivisceral transplant and organ procurement, which provides excellent exposure of this anatomic region. From May 1999 to April 2006, 70 patients underwent en bloc mobilization of the spleen and the pancreas and, as necessary, the stomach for masses in the left upper retroperitoneum. Pathology included malignant and benign lesions, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with or without inferior vena cava (IVC) involvement, adrenal tumors, retrocrural lymphadenopathy from testicular cancer, and transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis. An extended subcostal transabdominal approach was used to resect large tumors in the left upper abdomen. This approach offers significant advantages over conventional approaches, including a flank, thoracoabdominal, or midline transabdominal incision with reflection of the descending colon. Intraoperative variables, including operative time, blood loss, transfusion rate, and extent of mobilization were recorded. Postoperative complications, including prolonged intubation, ileus, and deep venous thrombosis were also noted. Mean estimated blood loss during surgery was 973 ml. There were no perioperative deaths. No patients had pancreatitis or acute renal failure. Deep venous thrombosis was not seen. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used in one patient with an atrial thrombus. At a median follow-up of 42 mo, two patients died due to metastasis. Techniques acquired from organ harvesting as well as our experience at multivisceral transplant, such as en bloc mobilization of the spleen, pancreas, and stomach, can be utilized safely and effectively to gain excellent exposure to the left upper retroperitoneum via an extended subcostal incision with no additional morbidity for the patient.";"2009";"European urology";"Abdominal Cavity; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Adrenalectomy; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Loss, Surgical; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; Cohort Studies; Dissection; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Nephrectomy; Organ Transplantation; Pancreas; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Spleen; Stomach; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Burden; Vascular Neoplasms; Vena Cava, Inferior; Young Adult"

From a prospectively collected database, 4378 patients underwent surgery for colorectal cancers between 1995 and 2003. Patients who developed brain metastases were identified and their records reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-seven patients who developed brain metastases were identified, for an incidence of 0.62%. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a tumor in the rectum or sigmoid; 92.6% of patients had metachronous brain secondaries. The median interval between surgery for the primary tumor and the discovery of a brain secondary was 27.5 months. The lung was the most common site of concurrent metastatic disease, with the discovery of a brain secondary a median of 9.7 months after diagnosis of the lung lesion. All patients were symptomatic. The majority of the patients received nonsurgical treatment for the brain lesion. Median survival after diagnosis of brain secondaries was 2.4 months. The poor survival of the patients in our series could be due to late diagnosis. It may be recommended that a brain scan be performed to screen for a brain secondary when lung and/or liver metastases are discovered, especially in a patient with a left-sided cancer.

Different genetic abnormalities have been found in colorectal cancers from different sites. For example, proximal colon cancer is usually related to the nucleotide instability pathway, as microsatellite instability (MSI). However, distal colon cancer is usually associated with specific chromosomal instability (CIN). The development of cancer at the rectum, though similar to that at the colon, displays its own unique features. These differences might be partially attributed to different embryological development and physiological circumstances. Environmental factors such as diet and alcohol intake also differ in their role in the development of tumors in the three segments, proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum. &quot;Proximal shift&quot; of colon cancer has been known for some time, and survival rates of colorectal cancer are higher when rectal cancers are excluded, both of which emphasize the three different segments of colorectal cancer and their different properties. Meanwhile, colonic and rectal cancers are distinctive therapeutic entities. The concept of three entities of colorectal cancer may be important in designing clinical trails or therapeutic strategies. However, the dispute about the inconsistency of data concerning the site-specific mechanism of colorectal carcinoma does exist, and more evidence about molecular events of carcinogenesis and targeted therapy needs to be collected to definitely confirm the conception.";"2009";"Journal of Zhejiang University.

For men, the model included a cancer-negative sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy in the last 10 years, polyp history in the last 10 years, history of CRC in first-degree relatives, aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), current leisure-time vigorous activity, and vegetable consumption.

Fifty-three credentialed surgeons operated on 871 patients in the Clinical Outcomes of Surgical Therapy Study (NCT00002575), investigating laparoscopic versus open surgery for colon cancer. Credentialing required that each surgeon document performance of at least 20 laparoscopic colon cases and demonstrate oncologic techniques on a video-recorded case. Surgeons were separated based on volume entered into the trial (low, &lt; or =5 cases (n = 39); medium, 6-10 cases (n = 9); or high, &gt;10 cases (n = 5)) and compared by outcomes. Patients treated by high volume compared with medium or low volume surgeons were older (70, 66, and 68 years; P &lt; 0.001), more often had right-sided tumors (63%, 46%, and 53%; P &lt; 0.001) and had more previous operations (48%, 38% and 45%; P &lt; 0.004), respectively. Mean operative times were shorter (123, 147 and 145 minutes; P &lt; 0.001), distal margins longer (13.4, 12.4 and 11.6 cm; P = 0.005), and lymph node harvest greater (14.8, 12.8, 12.6; P = 0.05) for high versus medium versus low volume surgeons. However, rates of conversion, complications, 5-year survival, and disease-free survival showed no significant differences. When tested in a randomized controlled trial with case-specific surgical technical credentialing and auditing, surgeon volume did not predict differences in rates of conversion, complications, or long-term cancer outcomes. Case-specific technical credentialing should be further studied specific to the role it could play in creating consistent, high quality outcomes.";"2008";"Annals of surgery";"Aged; Clinical Competence; Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal Surgery; Credentialing; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome"

The present study aimed to test the technical feasibility of this procedure. Fifty-four consecutive male patients with clinically staged III rectosigmoid cancer were recruited to undergo laparoscopic D3 lymph node dissection. The extent of the D3 lymphadenectomy of rectosigmoid cancer included skeletonization of bilateral common iliac arteries and veins and abdominal aorta upwards to the level of the duodenal third portion and left renal vein, in addition to the mesenteric dissection in the standard anterior resection. The patients were prospectively followed for surgical feasibility, efficiency, and outcomes. Laparoscopic D3 lymphadenectomy for rectosigmoid cancer was performed with acceptable operation time (303.4 +/- 35.8 min, mean +/- standard deviation) and moderate blood loss (344.8 +/- 50.6 ml) through small wounds. There was no mortality within 30 days after operation and the complication rate was acceptable (20.4%). The patients has quick functional recovery, as evaluated by the restoration of flatus passage (60.4 +/- 12.4 h), hospitalization (11.0 +/- 1.5 days), and the degree of postoperative pain (3.5 +/- 0.6, visual analogue scale). D3 lymphadenectomy resulted in the harvest of ample lymph nodes (24.6 +/- 4.5) for histopathological examinations and facilitated the upstaging of three (5.6%) patients. D3 lymph node dissection by the laparoscopic approach can be safely and efficiently performed for male rectosigmoid cancer with quick convalescence.";"2009";"Surgical endoscopy";"Feasibility Studies; Humans; Laparoscopy; Lymph Node Excision; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Rectal Neoplasms; Sigmoid Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome"

This study aimed at assessing the preservation of continence function of the residual rectum and the clinical prognosis of patients with lower rectal cancer after intersphincteric resection using a prolapsing technique. This study included patients with the following inclusion criteria: (1) pathological evidence of rectal cancer and the tumors within distal margins located 5 cm or less from the anus by preoperative endoscopic examination; (2) no evidence by MRI of infiltration of either the external sphincter, puborectalis or the levator muscle; (3) the patients are eligible for intersphincteric resection and lower coloanal anastomosis with a preoperative biopsy showing the tumors with well-to-moderate differentiation. From January 2000 to June 2004, 23 patients with low rectal cancer were included in this study. We used the standard abdominoperineal approach to perform radical resection of tumors with excision of the mesorectum and total or part of the internal sphincters. The patients were followed for assessment of the function of the residual rectum and of cancer recurrence after the operations. The median tumor distance from the anal margin was 4.5 (range 3.5 - 5.0) cm and the mean distal surgical margin 1.6 (range 1.0 - 2.0) cm. Cancer was classified into Stage I (30.4%), Stage II (47.8%), and Stage III (21.7%) according to the TNM classification. Two patients developed anastomotic fistula after the surgical resection and 2 patients (8.7%) developed later stages of anastomotic stricture at the site of coloanal anastomosis. The median follow-up period was 31.5 months (range 12 - 54) and 2 patients (8.7%) developed local recurrence. Three deaths were associated with distal organ metastasis. Twenty patients (87.0%) have maintained competence to control solid or liquid stool and the capacity of flatus continence after the surgery. Among these patients, 2 patients were able to control solid stool and occasionally lose continence of liquid stool. And only 1 patient (4.4%) has retained partial rectum function with good continence of solid stool but not liquid after the operations. Average times of defecation per day of 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after the surgery were 13.1, 4.7, 3.1, 2.9, and 3.2 times/day. Anal manometer measurements showed a decrease of pressure during the resting time after intersphincteric resection and this change remained during the period of follow-up. The maximum squeeze pressure was improved after an initial decrease after the surgery. More residual rectum function after the surgery may be preserved by intersphincteric resection of low rectum cancer. At the same time this technique is safe with few postoperative complication and low tumor recurrence after the surgery.";"2009";"Chinese medical journal";"Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum"

The first case involved a 78-year-old woman with a permeative osteolytic lesion in her proximal second metacarpal. A biopsy of this lesion suggested a diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinoma with secondary osseous metastasis. This was the first presentation of the woman's primary diagnosis. A single 8-Gy fraction of palliative radiotherapy was delivered to the patient's left hand. The treatment proved successful: the woman soon experienced pain relief and regained the use of her hand. The second case involved a 69-year-old woman with extensive lytic destruction involving the proximal two thirds of her third metacarpal. This patient had been diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast in 1990. She also received a single 8-Gy fraction of radiation, which improved both her pain and her hand mobility.An extensive review of the literature uncovered 257 previously reported cases of acrometastasis. Articles were analyzed based on age and sex of the patient, site of the primary carcinoma, metastatic locations within the hand and affected appendage or appendages, the treatment given, and the patient's length of survival. Men were almost twice as likely to experience acrometastasis as women, and the median age of the patients overall was 58 years (range: 18 months-91 years). Lung, kidney, and breast carcinoma were the three most prevalent primary diagnoses reported in the literature. Cancers of the colon, stomach, liver, prostate, and rectum affected the remainder of the population.Overall, the right hand was more often host to the metastatic lesions. In addition, almost 10% of the patients experienced lesions in both hands. The third finger was the digit most affected by osseous metastases reported in the literature. Lesions of the thumb, fourth finger, second finger, and fifth finger were less commonly reported. The region of the digit most often affected within the patient population was the distal phalanx. The metacarpal bones, proximal phalanges, and middle phalanges comprised the remainder of the four most frequent acrometastatic sites. In the literature, single lesions were more prevalent than multiple bony lesions.Based on the reported cases, amputation appeared to be the preferred method of treatment. Radiation, excision, and systemic therapy were the next most frequently used treatments. Patient survival was not well documented within the literature. However, the median survival of patients in the reported cases was 6 months. Thus, our review suggested that a diagnosis of hand metastasis is an indication of poor prognosis.This report serves to emphasize the importance of properly diagnosing acrometastases. Identifying and effectively treating these metastases in a timely manner can lead to a dramatic improvement in a patient's quality of life.";"2010";"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)";"Acrometastasis; bone metastases; hand metastasis"

It is unclear whether patient prognosis varies by tumor location. In this study, we have compared the survival of right-and left-sided colon cancers in a longitudinal population-based database. A retrospective survival analysis was performed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database between 1988 and 2003 on subjects who underwent surgical resection for the a primary diagnosis of pathologically confirmed invasive colon adenocarcinoma. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess long-term survival outcomes comparing right-sided (cecum to transverse colon, excluding appendix) versus left-sided (splenic flexure to sigmoid, excluding rectum) colon cancers. A total of 77,978 subjects were identified with adenocarcinoma of the colon. Overall median survival was 83 months. Median survival for right-sided cancers was 78 vs. 89 months for left-sided cancers (P &lt; .001). By Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, controlling for statistically significant confounders, including age, sex, race, marital status, tumor stage, tumor size, histologic grade, number of lymph nodes examined, and year of diagnosis, right-sided colon cancers were associated with a 5% increased mortality risk compared with left-sided colon cancers (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.07). These findings were consistent across subsets of subjects. On the basis of analysis of information from the SEER database, we found that right-sided colon cancers have a worse prognosis than left-sided colon cancers. The reason for this remains unclear but may be due to biological and/or environmental factors and may have particular bearing, given the rising incidence of right-sided colon cancers.";"2008";"Annals of surgical oncology";"Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; SEER Program; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome"

A prospective randomized study.";"Anastomotic leakage is a major problem in colorectal surgery particularly in low rectal cancer. The defunctioning loop ileostomy was introduced as a technique to create a manageable stoma that would divert the fecal stream from a more distal anastomosis in order to reduce the consequences of any anastomotic leakage. Therefore, the use of a defunctioning stoma has been suggested, but limited data exist to clearly determine the necessity of routine diversion. This study was designed to evaluate early morbidity, mortality and hospital stay in patients undergoing lower rectal cancer surgery concerned with or without loop ileostomy. This is a prospective randomized study that was performed between May 2001 and March 2008. There were 256 patients who underwent elective low anterior resection and stapler anastomosis. They were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 120 patients who underwent straight anastomosis without ileostomy and group B consisted of 136 patients who underwent straight anastomosis with loop ileostomy. Data regarding patient demographics, underlying pathology, anastomotic problems, and ileostomy-related problems were gathered. The patients were all monitored closely after surgery for an anastomotic leak and all stoma-related complications were recorded. Inclusion criteria consisted of biopsy proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum located at &lt; or = 5 cm above the anal verge, age &gt; or = 22 years, and informed consent. Exclusion criteria included age more than 90 years, associated co morbid conditions Stage IV with disease spread to liver and peritoneum. Indications for surgery were lower rectal cancer (n=256). Mean age 55.5 years (range 22-90 years) and a male: female ratio of 1.1:1. All patients were undergoing elective surgery for lower rectal cancer. In our study 12 patients in group A developed anastomotic leak, two of them were re-explored for anastomotic leak and Hartman's colostomy was carried out. There were two deaths in Group A. In group B anastomotic leak was seen in three patients. In all three, anastomotic healing took place at a later period of time on the 18th, 20th, and 25th postoperative day respectively without any additional morbidity and mortality. Ileostomy-related problems were minor and limited to the stoma and complaints requiring stoma nurse evaluation (n=8), dehydration requiring outpatient care (n=3), bleeding at the stoma closure site (n=l). No stoma site hernias have been identified so far. The use of defunctioning loop ileostomy in all patients undergoing lower rectal surgery with stapler anastomosis is beneficial and safe. Defunctioning loop ileostomy use has resulted in no anastomotic leak rate and considerable low morbidity. So according to our study, we strongly recommend defunctioning loop ileostomy as a routine procedure in patients undergoing lower rectal cancer surgery.";"2009";"Hepato-gastroenterology";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Female; Humans; Ileostomy; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Rectal Neoplasms"

The technique was also useful in eight elective and 13 emergency abdominal surgeries. All patients suffered from severe chronic obstructive airway disease requiring multiple inhalers and drugs (ASA III). Thirty nine of these patients also suffered from angina, myocardial infarction, diabetes and other systemic diseases (ASA IV). Surgery included right hemicolectomy, left hemicolectomy, total colectomy, sigmoid colectomy, Hartman's resection, anterior resection of rectum, abdominoperineal resection, cholecystectomy (open and laparoscopic) and obstructed inguinal hernia requiring laparotomy. Spinal anaesthesia was performed under strict aseptic conditions with a 22 gauge spinal needle with a mixture consisting of 2.75ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine and 0.25ml of fentanyl (25microg). This was followed by placement of a spinal micro-catheter and the duration of anaesthesia was extended by intermittent injection of 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine. Brief hypotension occurred in 12.4% of patients during the establishment of anaesthetic block height to T6-7 and was duly treated with intravenous administration of fluid and ephedrine hydrochloride. Good anaesthesia resulted in all patients except for brief discomfort in some patients during hemicolectomy surgery possibly due to the dissection and traction on the peritoneum causing irritation to the diaphragm. The use of sedation was avoided. General anaesthesia was administered in one patient and this patient required postoperative ventilation and cardiovascular support in the Intensive Care Unit. The spinal micro-catheter was removed at the end of surgery. Postoperative pain relief was obtained by administering intravenous morphine through a patient controlled analgesia machine in the critical care ward area (High Dependency Unit). There was a low incidence of minor postoperative side effects such as nausea (14.6%), vomiting (7.9%), minor post dural puncture headache (5.6%) and pruritus (5.6%). We conclude that spinal anaesthesia with a micro-catheter may be used as a primary method of anaesthesia for colorectal cancer surgery and other major abdominal surgery in high-risk patients for whom general anaesthesia would be associated with higher morbidity and mortality.";"2008";"Surgical oncology";"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anesthesia, Spinal; Catheterization; Cohort Studies; Colectomy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors"

Appreciation of gender disparities may assist in the implementation of measures to address these differences, and improve the overall outcomes of patients with CRC. The South Western Sydney Colorectal Tumour Group registry, which encompasses a population in excess of 800,000, prospectively collects data on new patients with CRC. Data from 1997 to 2004 were collected, including demography, site, grade, histopathology, stage, treatment, and survival. In total, 2,050 consecutive patients (44% women) with CRC were analyzed. Compared to men, women were older (median 69 yr, range 27-95 yr vs 67, range 22-92 yr, P= 0.001), had more emergency surgery for CRC-related complications (18.8%vs 15.1%, P= 0.03), had more proximal cancers (42.2%vs 31.5%, P &lt; 0.001), had more poorly differentiated cancers (16.9%vs 12.9%, P= 0.01), and had fewer radiotherapy treatments for Dukes B and C rectal cancers (36.4%vs 48.1%, P= 0.02). Young women (aged 50 yr and below) had significantly better overall survival compared to young men; in this group, female gender predicted improved overall survival independent of age, emergency surgery, site, grade, and stage (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.86, P= 0.01). Similarly, young women had significantly better cancer-specific survival (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.85, P= 0.01). However, older women (aged over 50 yr) had worse survival independent of age, emergency surgery, site, grade, and stage (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.14-1.68, P= 0.001). There were no gender differences in screening, histopathology, stage, or utilization of chemotherapy. This study demonstrated an opposing effect of gender on overall and cancer-specific survival at either side of the age of 50 yr. The protective effect of estrogen on CRC may be an important factor.

Deficient PTEN expression leads to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (pAkt) signaling pathway, which may contribute to multiple human cancers. The relation between PTEN expression and Akt activation is still unclear in colorectal cancers and adenomatous polyps. Moreover, PTEN and pAkt expression in relation to demographic, tumoral, and outcome variables remains to be elucidated. PTEN and pAkt expression were evaluated in 76 primary colorectal cancers and 25 adenomatous colorectal polyp tissues using immunohistochemical staining on paraffin-embedded sections. PTEN and pAkt expression were compared with clinicopathologic features of colorectal cancers. The relationship between PTEN and pAkt expression was also investigated. In colorectal cancers, pAkt expression was found to be significantly higher than polyps (P = .007). On the other hand, PTEN expression was significantly lower in polyps (P &lt;.0001). In colorectal cancer patients, PTEN expression showed a negative correlation with young age, female sex, and left-sided (distal) tumors. On multivariate analysis, low PTEN expression (PTEN loss) was noted as an independent parameter for local recurrence (P = .024). There was significant association between pAkt expression and stage (P = .008), and preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (P = .017) in colorectal cancers. A negative correlation between PTEN and pAkt expression was found in colon cancer patients (P = .010), whereas no significiant association was found in adenomatous polyps (P = .403). No correlation of PTEN expression or pAkt expression was observed in Kaplan-Meier survival statistics and multivariate analyses for disease-free and overall survival.

Elderly patients are often viewed as high-risk surgical candidates with high rates of emergency presentations and perioperative mortality. The aim of our study was to examine the characteristics and perioperative morbidity and mortality rates of elderly patients presented to CRC surgery. We retrospectively studied 248 patients who underwent surgery for CRC at our institution between July 2003 and December 2005. Risk factors included sex, age, cancer localization, Dukes' and TNM classification, blood transfusion, preoperative Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity score and mode of presentation. Primary outcome was perioperative death. The study consisted of 143 men and 105 women. One hundred and thirty-four (54%) patients were more than 75 years of age. In the two older groups, cancer was more common in the proximal colon than in the youngest age group (P = 0.001). Of the 25 resections carried out as emergency, 20 were in those who were more than 75 years of age (P &lt; 0.001). In elective procedure, perioperative mortality scores were 3.1% in those who were more than 75 years of age versus 0% in those less than 75 years, meanwhile in emergency, rates of 24 versus 0% (P = not significant) were registered. In Cox multivariate regression analysis, age and mode of presentation reached statistical significance. Old age itself is not an independent negative prognostic factor for CRC surgery.

To examine gender differences in incidence, hospitalization, hospital-based procedures and mortality for colorectal cancer. Data were derived from the Hospital Morbidity Database, Canadian Cancer Registry and the Canadian Mortality Database. Overall incidence and mortality rates for colorectal cancer are decreasing, but remain substantially higher for males. Absolute numbers of cases are similar for men and women. The top subsite for men was rectal cancer, which was third highest for women, whereas right colon cancer was highest for women. Male/female ratios for incidence and surgeries were highest for distal cancer and are increasing with time. Although overall incidence rates have shown a decline, absolute numbers of new colorectal cancer cases have increased. While men have higher colorectal cancer rates, women have similar numbers and screening should target both equally. Over the years, colorectal cancer subsites are showing a rightward shift, i.e. an increase in proximal subsites, but a leftward shift in male/female ratios, i.e. a greater decrease for the more distal subsites in females. The lower rates for women for distal cancer are compatible with a degree of hormonal protection based on oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy.

Frequent synchronous and bilobar liver involvement limits indications of surgery in LM from DET. From 1996 to 2004, of 41 patients with synchronous bilobar LM from DET, 23 (56%) were selected for 2-step surgery. The first step included resection of the primary tumor and limited (nonanatomic) resection of left LM (segments 1-4) associated with a right portal vein ligation. After 8 weeks, following hypertrophy of the cleared left liver, a right or extended right hepatectomy was planned. At the first step, all primary tumors (bowel = 12, distal pancreas = 10, rectal = 1) were resected and LM were resected in 20 patients (87%). One patient did not have second-step due to tumor progression. The second step (n = 19; 83%) was performed after a median interval of 8 weeks (range, 6-13) and a 54 +/- 21% mean left liver hypertrophy rate. Postoperatively, 4 (17%) and 4 (21%) patients developed nonlethal complications and the median hospital stay was 11 (range, 7-26) and 13 (range, 9-17) days after the first and the second step, respectively. The median number of resected LM was 4 (range, 1-9) and 7 (range, 4-17), respectively. With a median follow-up of 64 months (range, 6-122), of the 19 patients who had complete 2-step surgery, all except one are alive. The 2-, 5-, and 8-year Kaplan-Meier overall and disease-free survival rates were 94%, 94%, 79% and 85%, and 50% and 26%, respectively.

However, the oncological validity of this surgery has not yet been well analyzed, especially for advanced cancer. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical outcome of laparoscopic surgery for stage II/III colorectal cancer in our hospital. Between June 1999 and August 2006, 321 patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery in our hospital; of those 121 cases whose pathological findings revealed stage II/III were included in this study. Among these cases, we assessed a short-term outcome and a medium-term outcome in terms of survival evaluation. The male:female ratio was 73:48, and mean age of patients was 62.4 years. Thirteen tumors were located in the cecum, 29 in the ascending colon, five in the transverse colon, one in the descending colon, 43 in the sigmoid colon, and 30 in the rectum. Average duration of operation was 184 minutes, and mean estimated blood loss was 53.5 ml. Five patients (4.1%) were converted to open procedures. No intraoperative complication was observed but eight complications (6.6%) occurred postoperatively. Forty-two cases were classified as stage II, 62 as stage IIIA /B, and 17 as stage IIIC. Five patients died of cancer relapse (4.1%), and 18 cases had recurrence of disease (14.9%), to date. No port-site recurrence was detected. Overall five-year survival was 95.7% in stage II, 84.1% in stage IIIA/B, 70.0% in stage IIIC. Meanwhile disease-free five-year survival was 75.6% in stage II, 80.1% in stage IIIA/B, and 66.8% in stage IIIC.

We performed a nonrandomized retrospective descriptive study at the University hospital tertiary care center. From January 1990 to June 2002, a total of 15 patients with primary colonic lymphoma were identified from the tumor registry at University of Alabama at Birmingham and retrospectively reviewed under Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Demographic data, clinical features, treatment method (surgery and/or chemotherapy), recurrence rate, and survival were analyzed. The results are presented as mean +/- standard deviation or median and range. Differences in survival were evaluated by the log-rank test and the interval of disease-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Main outcome measures included surgical results, morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rate. Mean age was 51.5 years (standard deviation 16.4), 33 per cent were male and 67 per cent were female. Presenting symptoms were diarrhea (53.5%), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (13.3%), and nausea and vomiting (46.7%) secondary to low-grade obstruction. Concomitant colorectal disease was present in one patient with ulcerative colitis. Preoperative diagnosis of lymphoma was made in 13 patients (87%) with colonoscopy and biopsy. CT scan was performed in all patients; and none had radiographic evidence of systemic extension. Only one patient had a history of lymphoproliferative disease and exposure to radiation. The most common disease location was the cecum (60%), followed by the right colon (27%), and the sigmoid colon (13%). The mean lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) value was 214.9 u/L (range 129-309). Thirty-three per cent of the patients had an LDH value that was above the upper normal limit. LDH returned to normal after treatment in all patients. Operations performed consisted of right hemicolectomy (13), total proctocolectomy with ileal J J-pouch (1), and sigmoid colectomy (1). Eighty-seven per cent had negative margins at the time of operation. Twelve patients received postoperative chemotherapy (80%). According to the clinical classification of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the gastrointestinal tract (Lugano, 1993) all patients corresponded to stage IE. Mean hospital stay was 6.4 days (range 3-26). There was no surgical mortality and the morbidity rate was 20 per cent (3 patients). One patient had a systemic recurrence (7%) approximately 4 months after surgical resection. Mean follow-up was 31 months (median 2-73).

The procedure is a new minimally invasive therapeutic approach in selected cases with large, sessile or awkwardly located polyps. Unlike other techniques such as polypectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection completely removes the affected mucosa by resecting through the middle or deeper part of the submucosa. Another purpose of the procedure is to obtain specimens for accurate pathological staging.

Two hundred and twenty-eight consecutive resections for adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon and caecum were identified between 1998 and 2006. Tumour involvement of the posterior retroperitoneal surgical resection margin (RSRM) was recorded and correlated with tumour stage, grade and clinical outcome. RSRM positive patients were compared with CRM positive rectal tumours resected in the same surgical unit. Nineteen of 228 right hemicolectomies (8.4%) showed tumour involvement of the RSRM (defined as &lt; or = 1 mm). Approximately half of the RSRM positive patients underwent palliative resections because of synchronous distant metastases. Out of nine 'potentially curative' resections where the RSRM was involved, five patients subsequently developed metastatic recurrence and two isolated local recurrence. RSRM positivity was associated with advanced tumour stage and more extensive extramural spread than CRM positive rectal cancers. Retroperitoneal surgical resection margin involvement by caecal and ascending colon carcinoma is a marker of advanced tumour stage and associated with a high incidence of synchronous and metachronous distant metastasis.

Patients with incurable left-sided colorectal cancer who fulfilled the study criteria were randomly assigned to nonsurgical or surgical treatment. The primary outcome measure was survival in good health out of hospital (World Health Organization performance scores 0 or 1). A high number of serious adverse events in the nonsurgical arm led to premature closure of the trial. Ten patients were allocated to surgical treatment and 11 patients to nonsurgical palliation.

From February 2000 to November 2001 40 patients with cancer of the colic segment between the descending sigmoid junction and the low rectum underwent surgical colorectal resection and low ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery. At the end of 5 years of observation we report a survival rate of 70% which is not very far from the value reported in the literature. In our study, the incidence of lymph-node metastases, inexistent in patients with T1 grading increases with the increase in the TNM T grading but does not depend on the location of the cancer. In our patients age below 65 years was a negative prognostic indicator because colorectal tumours in patients of that age are associated with a higher incidence of lymph-node metastases. On the basis of the data we obtained, it is also evident that the 5-year survival rate decreases in proportion to the increase in the distance of the lymph-node metastases from the mesenteric margin of the colon. In conclusion, in the treatment of cancers located between the descending sigmoid junction and the low rectum, we prefer to execute a low ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery because it exposes the patient to a lower risk of intra- and postoperative complications and also because several authors have demonstrated that high ligation with removal of lymph nodes at the origin of the artery for colorectal cancer does not improve the 5-year survival rate.";"2008";"Chirurgia italiana";"Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arteries; Colectomy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Ligation; Lymph Node Excision; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Mesenteric Artery, Inferior; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; Sigmoid Neoplasms; Survival Rate"

Annual incidence of this problem has been estimated to be 20% and mortality as 11%. Patients complaining of haematochezia are suspected of having lower GI bleeding and proctosigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy is the examination of choice for diagnosis and treatment. Previous evidence suggested that in our country, frequencies of different aetiologies of lower GI bleed are different from the West. This study validated the previous findings. The Objective of this study was to determine the causes of rectal bleeding in adult patients at Military Hospital, Rawalpindi. One hundred and five adult patients with visible rectal bleed, irrespective of their gender were selected by non-probability convenient sampling from general medical OPD and general medical wards. Patients with suspected upper GI source of bleeding; haemorrhoidal bleed and acute infectious diarrhoea were excluded from the study. All patients were subjected to fibre-optic colonoscopy after necessary preparation and findings were recorded. Biopsies taken from suspected lesions were clinically indicated. Diagnosis was based on colonoscopic and histopathologic findings. A total of 105 patients (77 male and 28 female) with mean age 41.04 yrs were part of the study. Colonoscopy showed abnormal findings in 85 (84%) patients. The commonest diagnosis was ulcerative colitis, which was found in 48 (46%) patients. It was followed by colorectal carcinoma, 11 (10%) patients, and non-specific colitis, 9 (8%) patients. Other less frequent findings were colonic diverticuli, 7 (6%) patients, solitary rectal ulcer, 5 (4%) patients, colonic polyps in 3 (2.5%) patients and one case each of telangiectasia and Crohn's disease. Colonoscopy has very high diagnostic yield and would be recommended in the workup of patients presenting with bleeding per rectum. Ulcerative colitis was the leading cause of bleeding per rectum in this study; while infrequent findings of Crohn's disease, polyps and diverticuli indicate that these are uncommon in this region.";"2009";"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC";"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Colonoscopy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Incidence; Lower Gastrointestinal Tract; Male; Middle Aged; Sigmoidoscopy; Young Adult"

The current trend for the management of obstruction of left-sided colorectal carcinoma favours primary resection and anastomosis, as a safe and acceptable approach to selected patients. Retrospective review of 81 patients (46 male and 35 female, mean 64 years). Morbidity after emergency total colectomy was 21%, and mortality was 6%. There were 6 anastomotic complications (2 anastomotic disruptions and 4 anastomotic leaks). Mean hospital stay was 13 days. 82% patients had adequate continence. Traditional approach for left-sided colon obstruction is three-stage procedure (Bloch-Paul-Mikulicz). The idea of removing dilated colon proximal to an obstructing tumor is not new, since Lane suggested this option in 1914. In 1965 Hughes and Cuthberson described their experience with 12 patients. At the moment of laparotomy 20% patients had advanced malignant disease. The cumulative morbidity and mortality are high in three-stage procedure. Three-stage approach is associated with high permanent colostomy rate. One-stage resection with primary anastomosis of the obstructed left-sided colon is a safe alternative to staged procedures. Emergency radical resection can be safely performed in majority of patients with left-colon obstruction. Total colectomy with anastomosis is a suitable procedure for treating left-sided colonic obstruction provided that pelvic floor is adequate. Total colectomy has low mortality, acceptable morbidity and good quality of life. The success of the surgery depends on the selection of patients.";"2008";"Medicinski pregled";"Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colectomy; Colonic Diseases; Colonic Neoplasms; Emergencies; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged"

We prospectively evaluated patient survival and outcomes in patients undergoing laparoscopic rectal resection for rectal cancer at a single institution. From November 1999 to November 2005, 107 patients with rectal cancer were treated by laparoscopy. Exclusion criteria were: metastatic disease, advanced disease with invasion of adjacent structures, clinical or radiologic involvement of the external anal sphincter, previous colonic resection, synchronous colonic adenocarcinoma, and contraindications to laparoscopy. All patients were followed prospectively for survival and complications. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A laparoscopic sphincter-saving procedure was performed in 104 patients, 2 patients had a laparoscopic Miles operation, and 1 underwent a laparoscopic Hartmann's procedure. Mean operating time was 278 (range, 135-430) minutes. Conversion to open surgery was required in 20 of 107 patients (18.7 percent). Overall morbidity was 27 percent, anastomotic leakage occurred in 14 of 104 patients (13.5 percent). There was no postoperative mortality. A mean of 18 (range, 1-49) lymph nodes was removed. Mean distance of distal margin from tumor was 2.6 (range, 0.5-10) cm; in two patients there was microscopic invasion of the distal margin. Mean hospital stay was nine (range, 4-43) days.

To determine whether prevalence and risk factors for anastomotic leakage (AL) differed between right and left elective colectomy for cancer, we conducted univariate and multivariate analyses and compared 33 variables (15 preoperative, 18 intraoperative) culled prospectively for 520 right and 1,230 left colectomies, followed by immediate anastomosis in 1,750 adult patients with or without AL. The overall AL rate was 4% (71 of 1,750) and was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001) for right (7 of 520=1.35%) than for left colectomy (64 of 1,230=5.20%).

Although surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation can often control primary tumor growth, successful eradication of disseminated metastases remains rare. We have now tested whether direct targeting tumor tissues to generate antitumor immune response before surgical excision produces sufficient CTL against micrometastases. One unsolved problem is whether such response allows coming CTL to be educated and then exit the tumor site. Another unsolved problem is whether these CTL can then patrol and effectively eliminate spontaneously metastasized tumor cells in the periphery. In this study, we have shown that adenovirus-expressing TNFSF14 [LIGHT (name derived from homologous to lymphotoxins, shows inducible expression, and competes with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes); Ad-LIGHT] inoculated directly into primary 4T1 tumor, a highly aggressive, spontaneously metastasizing mammary carcinoma, followed by surgical removal of the primary tumor can eradicate established and disseminated metastatic tumor cells in the peripheral tissues. Furthermore, we clearly show with a fibrosarcoma model Ag104L(d) that local treatment can generate plenty of tumor-specific CTL that exit the primary tumor and infiltrate distal tumors to completely eradicate distal tumors.

Our research has shown that among Southeast Asian countries, Singapore has the highest age-standardized incidence rates, 35.1% in men and 29.9% in women, more than twice that of the next country; these rates have been increasing at a startling average annual rate of approximately 2.6 and 2.35%, for men and women, respectively. Between 1998 and 2002, deaths from colorectal cancer constituted 19% of all cancer mortalities in men and 14% in women, accounting for the second highest cause of cancer mortality in both genders. In the same period, more than three quarters (75.6%) of colorectal cancers occurred in the distal colon (including splenic flexure, descending, sigmoid colon and rectum), with the predominant histological subtype being adenocarcinoma (approximately 90%). The age-specific rates for colorectal cancer begin to increase sharply in the 40- to 45-year age group. It remains the most common primary site of cancer in men aged between 35 and 64 years but lies a distant second after breast cancer in women. In individuals aged 65 years and above, colorectal cancer remains prominent in both genders. Despite the dramatic increase in incidence of colorectal cancer in Singapore, there has also been significant progress in survival of colorectal cancer patients with localized disease (limited to large bowel), with 5-year, age-standardized relative survival improving from 36 to 66% in men and 32 to 71% in women; in rectal cancer, improvements from 25 to 66% in men and 23 to 66% in women were also observed.

We conducted a matched case-control study of the oncologic outcome of T1 and T2 rectal cancer patients who had undergone Lap-R between 1996 and 2002 by matching them for sex, age, location, and TNM classification with patients who underwent O-R during the same period, and the total number of subjects in both groups combined was 76. The median follow-up period in the Lap-R group was 36 months, as opposed to 58 months in the O-R group. There were no operative deaths in either group. Comparison of the postoperative complications showed that intraoperative blood loss was significantly less in the Lap-R group than in the O-R group (P &lt; 0.0001), and there were fewer cases of intestinal obstruction (p = 0.0312). The number of postoperative hospital days was also significantly shorter (p = 0.00046). The overall survival rate was 91.6% in the Lap-R group and 92.7% in the O-R groups, and the difference was not significant (p = 0.5306). The recurrence-free survival rate was 96.7% in the Lap-R group and 82.4% in the O-R group, and the difference was not significant (p = 0.4587). The difference in recurrence rate between the groups was not significant (p = 0.446), and there were no differences in modes of recurrence, but local recurrence was the most common mode in both groups. No recurrences were observed at the site of the port in the Lap-R group. When we performed our matched case-control study of Lap-R and O-R as surgical procedures for T1 and T2 rectal cancer, Lap-R was less invasive based on the short-term outcome. Moreover, there were no significant differences in mode of recurrence or recurrence rate, and no significant difference between the two groups was observed in oncologic outcome. It will be necessary to await the results of both Japanese and international randomized controlled trials (RCT).

There are some controversies about performing radical operations because colorectal cancer perforation was considered as an advanced stage disease due to the possibility of tumor cell dissemination through the perforation site. We selected and enrolled 26 patients with perforated colorectal cancers among the 1,227 patients who underwent operation for colorectal cancer. These cases were retrospectively analyzed by using their medical records and clinicopathological data. Twenty-eight cases (2.3%) with perforated colorectal cancers were studied and the overall operative mortality rate was 11%. The overall 5-year survival rate was 57.8% when excluding the operative mortality. The overall 5-year cancer-free survival rate was 52.8%. There were significant differences in the survival rate and the cancer-free survival rate between the stages (p=0.008 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). A univariate analysis of the prognostic factors revealed that the number of the metastatic lymph nodes (p=0.018) and the perforation proximal to the cancer (p=0.005) were significantly correlated to worse survival, and the higher number of the metastatic lymph nodes was correlated to a poorer cancer-free survival rate (p&lt;0.001). For the perforated colorectal cancers, the stage, the perforation proximal to the cancer, and the number of the metastatic lymph nodes were correlated, with the survival and the cancer-free survival as factors of a poor prognosis. The surgical approach selected for perforated colorectal cancer should be in line with the principles of an appropriate cancer operation because the clinical pathway of perforated colorectal cancer is similar to that of uncomplicated colorectal cancer.";"2007";"International journal of colorectal disease";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Intestinal Perforation; Korea; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate"

TNM stage II and III primary colon carcinomas (N = 528) from patients enrolled in 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant trials were analyzed for MSI using 11 microsatellite markers. Immunostaining for DNA mismatch repair (hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6) and p53 proteins was performed. DNA ploidy (diploid vs aneuploid/tetraploid) and proliferative indices (PI: S-phase + G(2)M) were analyzed by flow cytometry. MSI-H was found in 95 (18%) colon cancers.

This study was designed to analyze the causes and foreseeable risk factors linked to postoperative morbidity on the grounds of data derived from a single-center surgical population. From September 1989 to March 2005, 287 consecutive patients, affected either with HCC or liver metastasis, had liver resection at our department. Among the HCC series we recorded 98 patients (73.2%) in Child-Pugh class A, 32 (23.8%) in class B and 4 in class C (3%). In 104 colorectal metastases, 71% were due to colon cancer, 25% rectal, 3% sigmoid, and 1% anorectal. In 49 non-colorectal metastases, 22.4% were derived from breast cancer, 63.2% gastrointestinal tumors (excluding colon) and 14.4% other cancers.

Inclusion criteria were reasonable operative risk, resectable acutely obstructed carcinoma, massively distended colon of dubious viability, and likely to contain ischemic lesions, signs of impending cecal perforation, and masses suggesting synchronous colonic cancers. Postoperative mortality was 9.7% (7 patients). An 83-year-old woman died as a result of an anastomotic dehiscence; the six other deaths resulted of cardiopulmonary complications. Postoperative morbidity was 15% (11 patients) including two fistulas, which recovered without surgery. There were eight synchronous colon carcinomas. Six months after surgery, the mean daily stool frequency was two following subtotal colectomy and three after total colectomy.

Right sided tumors are typically bulky and late-stage; perforation may lead to abdominal wall or retroperitoneal abscess. Tumor can also extend or fistulize into adjacent organs. Distal transverse cancers may be small annular lesions which are prone to obstruction. Cancers present as T4 lesions in 20-40% of cases. Abdominal CT is the best test to evaluate the loco-regional extension of advanced tumors. Their central location and advanced stage at presentation results in an extensive differential diagnosis. This central location also poses difficult surgical choices for lymph node dissection, extent of resection, and re-establishment of intestinal continuity.

A total of 75 patients with colorectal cancer had pulmonary metastases excised from 1986 to 2003. Tumor size, number, laterality, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and carcinoembryonic antigen level were possible risk factors for metastatic tumors, with primary site of colorectal tumor, disease-free interval, and hepatectomy for liver metastasis possible risk factors for primary tumors. Prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analyses also included age and sex. Five-year survival rates were 41.3% after pulmonary excision and 73.1% after primary colorectal resection. Three factors identified as significant by univariate log-rank test for overall survival after pulmonary resection were carcinoembryonic antigen (p &lt; 0.0001), tumor laterality (p = 0.0205), and number of pulmonary metastases (p = 0.0028). Multivariate analysis found that carcinoembryonic antigen, tumor number, tumor size, and patient's age were also independent prognostic factors. In contrast, carcinoembryonic antigen, number of metastases, and disease-free interval predicted prognosis after primary colorectal resection. Prior hepatectomy for metastases did not influence prognosis after pulmonary metastasectomy. Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level and multiple metastases are preoperative predictors of poor prognosis after resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer.

However, few reports have addressed the safety and comparative outcome of laparoscopic colon operations that necessitated conversion. All consecutive laparoscopic colon resections performed by a single surgeon from July 1996 to October 2003 were assessed. Data obtained from a prospective computerized database included demographics, diagnosis, reason and time to conversion, length of stay, morbidity, and mortality. Additionally, all laparoscopic-converted colectomies were then matched with open colectomies by diagnosis and severity of disease and analyzed with respect to morbidity, mortality, and clinical outcome. A total of 143 laparoscopic colon resections were analyzed, 78 of which were left colon resections and 65 were right colon resections. The overall conversion rate was 19.6% (28 patients). The disease entities of the 28 converted patients were diverticulitis (16), polyps (four), Crohn's disease (three), metastatic cancer (three), and others (two). Conversion was higher in the left-sided (24 patients, 30.8%) versus right-sided (four patients, 6.1%) procedures. There were no differences regarding age, gender, and comorbidities among the laparoscopic, open, and converted groups; the median follow-up was 39 months. The median length of stay was 6, 8, and 12 days for the laparoscopic, open, and converted groups, respectively. Right-sided conversions were due to the size of the inflammatory mass in three patients and intraoperative bleeding in one patient. Left-sided conversions were due to the inflammatory process extending beyond the sigmoid colon in 12 patients, adhesions in five, obesity in four, pericolonic abscess in two, and fixed mass in one patient. Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher for laparoscopic procedures that were converted to open procedures more than 30 min into the operation. Preoperative predictors of conversion were extent of inflammatory process beyond the sigmoid colon and obesity, whereas intraoperative predictors were adhesions and bleeding. Laparoscopic-converted colon resection is associated with significantly greater morbidity, particularly wound complications and greater length of hospital stay, compared to open or laparoscopic colectomies. Prompt conversion (&lt;30 min) may reduce the overall morbidity associated with converted procedures. Furthermore, thoughtful patient selection may decrease the conversion rate and thereby prevent the inherent morbidity associated with converted procedures.";"2006";"Surgical endoscopy";"Colectomy; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Incidence; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Surgical Wound Infection"

The central adiposity measures of WHR (hazard ratio per 0.1 unit increase = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.58) and waist circumference (hazard ratio per 10 cm increase = 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.28) were positively associated with colon cancer risk. There was little or no association between other anthropometric measures and risk of colon cancer. There was some evidence that the associations were stronger for proximal tumors, but no evidence that risk differed by stage for any of the anthropometric measures. Central adiposity appears to be associated with colon cancer risk in women.";"2007";"International journal of cancer";"Abdominal Fat; Adult; Aged; Australia; Body Composition; Body Size; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Greece; Humans; Italy; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Registries; Surveys and Questionnaires; Waist-Hip Ratio"

Thus, we modified the pancreatoenteric procedure to reduce anastomotic leakage from the pancreatic stump after PD, and we conducted a study to evaluate the usefulness of the new procedure on the basis of patients' postoperative condition. We compared the postoperative condition of 21 patients who underwent PD with the new separated loop (SL) reconstruction (6 men, 11 women; mean age, 67.7+/-7.2 years) to that of 31 patients (12 men, 19 women; mean age, 66.8+/-10.3 years) who underwent PD with pancreatogastrostomy (PG). In the SL reconstruction procedure, the proximal jejunum is brought up behind the colon, and an end-to-side choledochojejunostomy is made with a single layer of interrupted sutures. Approximately 20cm of the jejunum is fitted with a fixed stomach tube for postoperative enteral feeding, and the cut proximal jejunum is positioned next to the pancreatic stump. A pancreatic tube is inserted into the lumen of the pancreatic duct and fixed without closing the pancreatic duct. Pancreatojejunostomy is achieved as an end-to-end anastomosis with the pancreatic stump telescoping into the proximal jejunum. Approximately 20cm of the jejunum is anastomosed side-to-end to the stomach, and end-to-side jejunojejunostomy is made to complete a Y-type reconstruction. Each patient's postoperative condition was also assessed on the basis of serum albumin (ALB), cholinesterase and total cholesterol (T-CHO) levels on postoperative days (PODs) 14 and 28. A high level of amylase in drainage fluid was noted in two (6.5%) and delayed gastric emptying in four (12.9%) of the patients in the PG group. There were no complications in the SL group. Postoperative levels of ALB on POD 14 and T-CHO on POD 28 were significantly higher than in the PG group. The SL method is safe and does not induce complications after PD.

If the same etiologic factors are operating for polyps and cancers their anatomical distributions should be the same. The present study was conducted to determine whether the distribution of adenomas is consistent with that of CRCs and for comparison with other studies, especially in Western populations. We reviewed, retrospectively , endoscopically reported anatomic sites of all adenomatous polyps and CRCs which were histologically confirmed from Jan 1992 to Dec 2005 in Tabriz, the North-west of Iran. One hundred and forty-three CRC's and 180 adenomatous polyps (in 145 patients) were found. Patients with polyposis syndromes were excluded the analysis. Age and sex of patients, size and anatomic sites of polyps and cancers were studied. The average ages of patients with adenomas and cancers were 46.3(SD 14.7) and 53.9(SD 13.3)years, with 55.5% and 62.2% in males, respectively. In both cancer and adenoma cases the most common presenting symptoms were rectal bleeding and bloody diarrhea ( 52.4% , 16.9% and 39.2% , 15.8% for cancers and adenomas, respectively) without any significant difference(0&gt;05).

The specific contribution of emergency surgery to adverse outcome is not clear because of the presence in all series of other possible determinants of a poor prognosis. We used a case-control study design to compare a group of 50 patients operated on for cancer of the rectum and left colon presented as emergencies in our department during the last 14 years, and an equal number of patients who underwent elective procedures during the same period. All records of these patients were reviewed and matched for age, stage, tumor location, and medical comorbidities (coronaropathy, diabetes mellitus, cerebral vascular deficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Outcome measures included length of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, and actuarial 5-year survival. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors potentially influencing survival was performed on the entire population of 100 patients. Age, tumor location, stage of disease, and medical comorbidities were well matched by intent of the study design. Overall surgical morbidity (44% versus 12% P = 0.0004), length of hospital stay (16, 64 versus 10, 97 days P = 0.0026) and postoperative mortality (4% versus 0% P = 0.4949) resulted higher in the emergency group. Actuarial overall 5-year survival was not different between the two groups. The only variables independently predictive of survival in multivariate analysis were age and rectal location of the tumor. Postoperative surgical mortality and long-term survival appear not to be influenced by emergency presentation of colorectal cancer; the negative impact of the emergency procedures is confined to the immediate postoperative period and is probably connected to the acute medical pathology often presented by patients in emergency situations.

The multicentre COLOR (COlon cancer Laparoscopic or Open Resection) trial was done to assess the safety and benefit of laparoscopic resection compared with open resection for curative treatment of patients with cancer of the right or left colon. 627 patients were randomly assigned to laparoscopic surgery and 621 patients to open surgery. The primary endpoint was cancer-free survival 3 years after surgery. Secondary outcomes were short-term morbidity and mortality, number of positive resection margins, local recurrence, port-site or wound-site recurrence, metastasis, overall survival, and blood loss during surgery. Analysis was by intention to treat. Here, clinical characteristics, operative findings, and postoperative outcome are reported.

Between March 1993 and July 2003, we performed laparoscopic right hemicolectomy in 56 patients with right colon carcinoma. Average age was 74.5 years (range, 17-92). We performed a standardized surgical procedure that included mobilization from the vascularized mesenteric bridges with a window technique, transection of the ileocolic lymphovascular pedicle, and lateral and proximal mobilization of the ileocecum, ascending colon, right flexure, and proximale transversum. After enlargement of one of the trocar incisions the exteriorized colon was resected and an extracorporeal anastomosis was performed in the standard manner. There were no conversions to open. The mean operating time was 119 +/- 38 min, the mean length of resected colon was 27.8 +/- 4.48 cm, and the average width of the clear margins was 6.8 +/- 5.3 cm. One patient died. Lymph nodes were positive in 21 patients. The 5-year survival rate in the 48 patients who were operated on with curative intent was 75%. We have had two local recurrences. The overall 5-year mortality-free fraction was 63%. Cox multivariate analysis showed that the mortality-prognostic factors were tumor stage and length of resected colon, whereas Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the mortality-prognostic factors were positive lymph nodes and tumor stage. Our results show that laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for colon cancer can be performed safely.

Within a 10-year-period, all patients requiring laparoscopic stoma creation were evaluated prospectively. Patients' profiles and indications, procedures and results of operation, conversion, morbidity, mortality and short-term complications (stoma-related, laparoscopy-associated) were analyzed. A total of 80 patients (39 males, 41 females) with a mean age of 55.5 years (range, 17-91) underwent laparoscopic stoma creation. Most common indications were unresectable advanced colorectal cancer (n=20), pelvic malignant cancer (e. g. ovarian, cervix and prostate cancer, n=16), and perianal Crohn's disease with complex fistulas (n=16). Only in one female patient with pelvic malignant disease was the procedure converted to laparotomy due to obesity (conversion rate, 1.3%). 79 patients underwent laparoscopic stoma creation (completion rate, 98.7%) including loop ileostomy (n=30), loop sigmoid colostomy (n=40) and end sigmoid colostomy (n=9).

We performed an analysis of TME for rectal cancer by laparoscopic approach during a prospective nonrandomized trial. A prospective consecutive series of 98 laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) procedures for low and mid-rectal tumors. All patients had a sphincter-saving procedure. Case selection, surgical technique, and clinical and oncological results were reviewed. The distal limit of rectal neoplasm was on average 5.4 cm (range 3-12) from the anal verge. The mean operative time was 192.5 min (range 125-360). The conversion rate was 18.4%. The mean postoperative stay was 11.6 days (range 4-61). The 30-day mortality rate was 1% (1/98) and the overall postoperative morbidity was 18.4% including 10 anastomotic leakages. Concerning long-term oncological results, we evaluated 93 (94.8%) patients with a median follow-up of 46.3 months (range 12-132). During this period, 15.1% (14/93) died of cancer and 7.5% (7/93) are alive with metastatic disease. The port-site metastases rate was 2.1% (2/93). The locoregional pelvic recurrence rate was 2.1% (2/93): 1 stage II at 12 months and 1 stage III at 18 postoperative months, respectively. LTME is a feasible but technically demanding procedure (18.4% conversion rate). Our series confirms the safety of the procedure, while oncological results are at present comparable to the open published series with the limitation of a short follow-up period.

This study was designed to examine site-specific survival implications of p53 and mismatch repair status. Mismatch repair (hMLH1 and hMSH2) and p53 status was investigated immunohistochemically in 111 proximal colon cancers along with tumor TNM stage, grade, and extramural vascular invasion. Fisher's exact test was used to assess categoric data; univariate and multivariate models compared survival between the respective tumor phenotypes. Thirty-two percent of tumors showed loss of expression of hMLH1 and in a multivariate analysis were associated with a significant survival advantage after adjustment for tumor stage, p53 status, and extramural vascular invasion (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1-0.87; P = 0.027). Only two tumors showed loss of expression of hMSH2, which was not related further to survival. Aberrant p53 expression was detected in 39 percent of tumors. Such expression was found to be associated with a significantly reduced survival in univariate analysis (P = 0.037, log-rank test) but not in a multivariate model. Subgroup analysis showed no association between survival and p53 expression in mismatch repair proficient tumors.

A prospective controlled study of seventy nine patients with low rectal carcinoma was done between January 1999 and March 2003. Two types of operations were done; SSP (43 patients) including a low anterior resection with either double-stapling technique (DST) (18) or hand-sewn colorectal anastomosis (HSA) (25), and APR (36 patients). The outcome factors evaluated were operative time, intraoperative blood loss, mortality, morbidity, disease-free survival and tumor recurrence. Patients have been followed-up for a minimum of 12 months (mean time 32 months). Out of 43 patients who underwent SSP, there was one mortality, and 7 morbidities. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 4 cases; one patient needed colostomy. In APR group, no mortalities and 6 morbidities were found. Morbidity was similar in both groups. The local recurrence rates for SSP and APR were 13.8% and 22.2%, respectively (p = 0.540), and the distant metastases rates were 11.1% and 8.3%, respectively (p = 1.000). Two-year disease-free survival rates for SSP and APR patients were 73.3% and 66.7%, respectively (p = 0.121). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in SSP groups. Sphincter saving procedures can be performed to all patients with rectal carcinoma regardless of the site of the lesion so long the distal and lateral margins are clear. Survival and the risk of local recurrence are similar to that obtained by standard abdomino-perineal resection.

To decrease the rate and severity of anastomotic leakage, omentoplasty (OP) has been proposed by several authors on the basis of experimental and clinical studies. A prospective, randomized trial was designed to study the influence of omentoplasty on anastomotic leakage after colorectal resection. One hundred and twenty-six patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery for malignancy, benign tumor, diverticular disease and other were randomly assigned to omentoplasty (OP group) or not (NO group). The primary end point was the rate of clinical and radiological anastomotic leakage. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic data, preoperative characteristics and intraoperative findings. Eighteen patients (14.3%) had anastomotic leakage, 4 (6.4%) in the OP group and 14 (21.9%) in the NO group. Significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between the two groups were also found in terms of repeat operation (3.2% vs. 14.1%) and deaths (3.2 vs. 7.8%).

Five patients (17%) had developed peritonitis due to perforation proximal to the tumour and three patients (10.5%) had developed necrotic colitis and haemorrhage due to the obstruction. In 23 patients (79.5%) a radical curative operation was feasible [11 (38%) subtotal colectomies with ileo-rectal anastomosis, seven (24%) Hartman's, three (10%) right hemicolectomy and two (7%) on table bowel lavage plus colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis] and in six (11%) only palliative operations could be done (transverse loop colostomy). In all cases the postoperative period was uneventful. Three patients with palliative operation were submitted to a radical curative operation 2 months later and the other three patients died 6 months later from causes irrelevant to the primary disease.

The study spanned a 3 years from September 1999 to August 2002. The observed variables were the volume of irrigated saline, time for irrigation and colonoscopic examination, synchronous pathology, operative mortality and morbidity, time to passage of flatus, restarting day of oral intake, and length of hospital stay. The mean volume of irrigated saline was a mean of 12.5 l (range 1-32) over a mean of 14.2 min (range 1-45). Subsequent colonoscopic examination added a mean of 10.7 min (range 3-15). The incidence of synchronous polyps was 47% (35 of 75 cases) in performing the on-table colonoscopic investigations. On-table colonoscopy induced surgeons to extend resection because of synchronous malignancy attested by frozen biopsy specimen in ten patients and because of mucosal necrosis of the proximal colon in three. There were two anastomotic leakages, six wound infections, and one operative mortality. The time to passage of flatus was an average of 3.6 days (range 1.0-7). The time to oral intake was an average of 4.3 days (range 3-8). The length of hospital stay was 11.7 days (range 6-43).

In the period 1990-2002 in the Emergency Surgery Department of the University of Naples Federico II, 81 patients underwent colon surgery for obstructing colon cancer (25 M, 57 F, age range: 55-88 years, mean: 72). Were performed subtotal colectomies, left or right hemicolectomies, sigmoid colectomies, anterior resections, temporary or permanent enterostomies. The authors put morbidity and mortality in touch with the type of surgical operation and with results of the literature. Mortality was 32%: 2.4% as a result of an anastomotic dehiscence; 4.9% for cardiovascular pathologies; 1.2% for sepsis; 23.4% for metastasis. Morbidity for anastomotic leakage was 4.9%: 2.4% after left emicolectomy and colo-colonic anastomosis; 1.2% after right emicolectomy and ileo-colonic anastomosis; 1.2% after defunctioning colostomy and left emicolectomy after 20 days. This experience suggests that a subtotal colectomy with primary anastomosis (one stage) can be performed more safely, by an experienced, skilled surgeon, in patients in good clinical conditions with acute obstruction of the colon. Healing remains a process depending more on the patient than on any aspect of the surgical technique. A defunctioning colostomy may be idealfor surgeons with little experience in colorectal surgery and in high risk patients with a very poor prognosis (unresectable lesions).";"2005";"Annali italiani di chirurgia";"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Colostomy; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Palliative Care; Postoperative Complications; Sigmoid Neoplasms"

A previous randomized study has reported an unforeseen better long-term survival for node-positive patients treated by laparoscopic colectomy. A single-institution prospective nonrandomized trial compared short- and long-term results of laparoscopic and open curative resection for adenocarcinoma of the left colon or rectum in 255 consecutive patients from January 1996 to December 2000. In this study, 34 left hemicolectomy, 202 anterior resections, and 19 abdominoperineal resections were performed. A total of 74 patients underwent a laparoscopic resection (LR), and 181, an open resection (OR). The tumor site was the descending colon in 32 cases, the sigmoid colon in 98 cases, and the rectum in 125 cases, including 87 mid-low rectal cancers. Ten LR procedures (13.5%) were converted to open surgery. The hospital mortality was 0.08%, and in hospital morbidity was 16.2% for LR and 13.3% for OR (p = 0.56). The median postoperative stay was 1 day shorter for LR (9 days) than for OR (10 days) (p = 0.09). The mean number of lymph nodes retrieved were 13.8 +/- 5.7 for OR and 12.7 +/- 5; for LR (p = 0.23). Age exceeding 70 years, T stage, N stage, grading, mid-low rectal site, and laparoscopy were found by multivariate analysis to be significant prognostic factors for disease-free and cancer-related survival. When patients were stratified by stage, a trend toward a better disease-free and cancer-related survival was identified in stage III patients undergoing LR. Laparoscopic colonic resection is a safe procedure in terms of postoperative outcome and long-term survival. Multivariate analysis showed that laparoscopy is a positive prognostic factor for disease-free and cancer-related survival. The current data agrees with the data for the only randomized study reported so far.

The authors performed esophageal reconstruction with a pedicled right colon graft after salvage esophagectomy in eight patients. To decrease the rate of anastomotic leakage, the authors performed an additional microvascular anastomosis at the distal end of the graft. The distal stumps of the ileocolic artery and vein were anastomosed to the cervical vessels. After surgery, aspiration pneumonia and localized wound infection were observed in two patients each, but slight anastomotic leakage was observed in only one patient. Postoperative swallowing function was satisfactory in all patients.

However, the widespread popularity of this technique may have created the potential of anal sphincter injury during transanal insertion of the anastomosing stapler. Thus, to avoid the risk of anal sphincter injury during anal manipulation, we have been performing an abdominal approach, namely abdominal stapled side-to-end anastomosis (ASSEA) using a Purstring and premium curved EEA stapler in low and high anterior resection. This study will present our experience and results of consecutive resections. ASSEA following a resection of the rectum and sigmoid colon for carcinomas was consecutively performed between October 1998 and May 2002. Age, sex, pre-operative anal function, the TNM classification by the UICC rules, operative methods, postoperative morbidity, mortality, anal function and bowel frequency were evaluated. Sixty-nine consecutive patients underwent a resection of the rectum and sigmoid colon with ASSEA. There were three (4.3%) clinical anastomotic leakages in the cases studied. Anastomoses that were located above the peritoneal reflection leaked in one (2.5%) of 40 cases, while anastomoses below the peritoneal reflection leaked in two (6.9%) of 29 cases. A diverting stoma was performed in five (17%) of the 29 cases with low anastomosis. Postoperative anal function was stable without soiling or faecal leakage and bowel frequency two months after surgery was less than four times in all 61 patients. There was no postoperative mortality related to the anastomosis.

In the management of obstructing colorectal carcinoma, primary resection and anastomosis can be performed in elective conditions with favorable outcomes with preoperative decompression of the obstruction using decompression tubes or self-expanding stents and is the treatment of choice. Even in patients in whom the obstruction fails to improve, the current trend favors intraoperative on table lavage followed by primary resection and anastomosis, except when patients are hemodynamically unstable during surgery or when the condition of the bowel is not optimal for primary anastomosis. For patients with colorectal perforation, the treatment of first choice is primary resection of the septic focus at the perforation site plus colostomy. Single-stage surgery (primary anastomosis after resection of the perforation site) or primary resection of the tumor in patients with perforation occurring far proximal to the cancer should be avoided to reduce the risk of postoperative complications, especially in patients with serious conditions. Intensive management to prevent sepsis including continuous blood purification methods such as polymixin B-immobilized fiber hemofiltration and continuous hemodiafiltration is required to improve the perioperative mortality rate.";"2004";"Nihon Geka Gakkai zasshi";"Colorectal Neoplasms; Emergencies; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Intestinal Perforation"

Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether the prognostic value of p27(kip-1) expression varies with the tumor site, tumor stage and patient ethnicity. We evaluated 206 (85 African Americans and 121 Caucasians) archival tissue specimens of first primary CRCs for immunohistochemical expression of p27(kip-1), and its prognostic significance was analyzed using univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression survival methods. Although, similar proportion of CRCs with decreased p27(kip-1) expression was observed in all stages (range, 26-36%), the decreased p27(kip-1) expression has been shown as a marker of poor prognosis only for patients with stage III tumors both in univariate (log-rank test, P = 0.014) and multivariate (hazard ratio = 3.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-7.7; P = 0.01) survival analyses. The decreased expression of p27(kip-1) was associated with a high histologic grade (P = 0.016) in stage II CRCs, and with distal tumors (P = 0.001), tumor invasion (P = 0.044), and with local recurrence (P = 0.008) in stage III CRCs. No prognostic significance was found for p27(kip-1) expression in stages I, II, or IV CRCs, and its prognostic value was not associated with either ethnicity or tumor location.

Left-sided tumors, especially rectal, rectosigmoid, and sigmoid, account for more than half of these tumors. Among many colorectal surgeons, the practice of rectal washout with cytocidal agents before anastomosis is common. It is widely believed that this practice prevents implantation of free malignant cells. It is unclear whether this translates into a reduction in the incidence of local recurrence. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cytocidal rectal washout in reducing the incidence of local recurrence. Case notes and histology reports of all patients who underwent curative anterior resection for adenocarcinoma of the rectum and rectosigmoid between 1992 and 1994 were reviewed. A total of 141 patients were deemed suitable for the study. Of these, 90 patients underwent rectal washout using cetrimide before anastomosis. Fifty-one patients did not have rectal washout before anastomosis. Local recurrences between the two groups were compared. The two study groups were identical in all respects. Overall, the local recurrence rate for all comers was 5 percent (n = 7). Among the washout group, the local recurrence rate was 4.4 percent (n = 4) compared with 5.9 percent (n = 3) among the no washout group.

The present study reports our experience of three patients with abdominal tumours prepared for surgery by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) in order to reduce portal hypertension and the risk of intraoperative bleeding. Three patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension diagnosed with a right colon carcinoma, an adenocarcinoma of pancreas and a gastric and sigmoid synchronic tumours in the same patient. Because portal hypertension was the leading cause of surgical contraindication, neoadjuvant TIPS placement was proposed before surgery. TIPS placement was performed without intra-procedure complications. An average reduction of 18 mmHg was achieved in portosystemic gradients. The planned operations were performed with a delay of 14-45 days after TIPS without intraoperative bleeding. Complications occurred in one patient without operative mortality. TIPS placement allows a pre-operative portal decompression in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and abdominal tumours that require surgical treatment. This procedure reduces the risk of bleeding by reducing the portosystemic gradient and the varices around the tumoral area. This procedure is less invasive than conventional shunt surgery, but it is not free of complications and should be performed by experienced interventional radiologists on selected patients. This is still an experimental indication of TIPS which efficacy must be confirmed in larger series.";"2004";"European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology";"Abdominal Neoplasms; Aged; Blood Loss, Surgical; Contraindications; Female; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Humans; Hypertension, Portal; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic; Postoperative Complications; Postoperative Hemorrhage"

A retrospective database of patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer adherent to the bladder between 1984 and 1999 was constructed.

Forty-five had en bloc partial cystectomy performed, four en bloc total cystectomy, and four had the adhesions disrupted and no bladder resection. The most common site of the primary colorectal cancer is sigmoid colon, with local invasion into the dome of the bladder. All patients who did not have en bloc resection developed local recurrence and died from their disease. Mean follow-up was 62 months. The extent of bladder resection did not seem important in determining local recurrence. En bloc resection of the urinary bladder should be performed if the patient is to be offered an optimal oncologic resection for adherent colorectal cancer. The decision to perform total rather than partial cystectomy should be based on the anatomic location of the tumor. Because the sigmoid is usually the primary site, most patients will not have received preoperative radiation. Therefore, postoperative radiotherapy may reduce local recurrence in these patients.";"2004";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cystectomy; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; New Zealand; Retrospective Studies; Urinary Bladder"

Sixty-seven of 73 (92%) had a primary resection with anastomosis; 38 of 67 (56%) had a protecting stoma. Five of 73 (7%) patients were found to have an unsuspected carcinoma. Overall, 29 of 192 (15%) developed a complication related to diverticulitis. Morbidity was 15.1%, of which 34% was infection related. Four of 192 patients (2%) died. In our experience, most patients presented with abdominal pain predominantly in the left lower quadrant. The symptoms were present on average of 14 days, most were female (59%), and most patients had a previous attack of diverticulitis. The commonest investigation performed was a CT scan (66.7%); however, other investigations were performed, for example, barium enemas. The practice of resection and primary anastomosis for acute diverticulitis has an acceptable morbidity and mortality. For high-risk anastomoses, a covering loop ileostomy and not a Hartmann's procedure is preferred. Surgery remains safe for the majority of patients and is associated with resolution of symptoms. We believe that because of the high number of patients in our series who had a previous attack of diverticulitis, therapy should be focused on preventing recurrent and virulent attacks by earlier operative intervention.";"2004";"American journal of surgery";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diverticulitis, Colonic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"

This study aimed to compare the outcome of patients with obstruction due to primary left-sided colorectal cancer treated by palliative stenting with outcome in patients who had undergone surgery. Patients with incurable obstructing primary colorectal cancer distal to the splenic flexure treated with emergency surgery (n = 31) or placement of a metallic stent (n = 30) from November 1997 to June 2002 were included. Data on the mortality, morbidity, necessity of intensive care and hospital stay for the two groups were compared. The subsequent outcomes, including the incidence of stoma creation and survival, were also analysed. The two groups were similar in terms of age, sex distribution and presence of co-morbidity. Insertion of metallic stents was successful in 29 of 30 patients. Hospital death occurred in four and eight patients in the study and control groups respectively (P = 0.335). Fewer patients with placement of a stent required intensive care (1 versus 11; P = 0.001) and the median hospital stay was shorter in patients with stenting (4 versus 8 days; P = 0.008). A stoma was subsequently created in four patients with stenting, whereas 15 patients who had emergency operation required a stoma (P = 0.005). The difference in median survival between the two groups was not statistically significant (107 versus 119 days; P = 0.088). Self-expanding metallic stents are effective in the palliation of obstructing colorectal cancer. Placement of stents is associated with a shorter hospital stay, less likelihood of intensive care and a lower incidence of stoma creation, when compared with emergency surgery. Thus insertion of a metallic stent should be considered in patients with incurable obstructing colorectal cancer.";"2003";"The British journal of surgery";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colorectal Neoplasms; Emergencies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Palliative Care; Stents; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome"

We examined whether there are differences in the degree of environmental effect on colon cancer and rectal cancer in Japan. We performed a birth cohort analysis for colon and rectal cancers using Japanese vital statistics from 1950 to 1998 and analyzed time trends by cancer site and gender. The mean annual increase in age-adjusted mortality rate from colon cancer was greater than that from rectal cancer and was greater in men than in women. In men left colon cancer showed the greatest rate of increase whereas cancer of the right colon showed only a slight change. Although left colon cancer rapidly increased until the middle 1980s and thereafter showed no change, right colon cancer showed no change until the middle 1980s and thereafter rapidly increased in men. However, the rates of increase in left colon cancer were greater than those in right colon cancer until the middle 1980s, after which a reversal in trend was seen in women. Birth cohort analysis indicates that for all cohorts the mortality rates at the same age were higher in the recent cohorts than in the previous ones. This trend was more marked for colon cancer than for rectal cancer and was stronger among men than among women. Colon cancer is more closely associated than rectal cancer with environmental factors, and this association is more pronounced in men than in women. Consequently cancers at these two sites should not be combined in studies of the role of lifestyle factors in causing these neoplasms.

Survival was improved except for cases with proximal colon cancer of Stage IV. In the multivariate analysis, hazard ratios for death in the postoperative five years were 0.77, 0.59, and 0.66 for proximal colon, distal colon, and rectal cancers, respectively, in the last period as compared with those in the first period [corrected].

This phenotype (CIMP+) is more frequently observed in tumors with proximal location, microsatellite instability, and normal p53. Because it has previously been observed that each of these features is associated with a good survival benefit from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy, we investigated in the present study whether CIMP+ has independent predictive value. CIMP+ status was evaluated in 103 stage III CRCs from patients treated with surgery alone and for an additional 103 cases from patients treated with surgery and adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy. The two cohorts were randomly pair-matched for age, sex, and tumor site, and the median length of follow-up time was 39 months. CIMP+ status predicted survival benefit from 5-FU treatment independently of microsatellite instability and p53 mutation status (relative risk = 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.84; P = 0.027). Unmeasured, high-risk confounding factors could only account for this association if they were unequally distributed between the two patient cohorts by a factor of at least 2-fold.

Patients (408) with stage IIIC epithelial ovarian cancer had cytoreductive surgery before systemic platinum-based combination chemotherapy. A ranking system (0-3) was devised to prospectively quantify the extent of disease involving: (1) right upper quadrant (diaphragm/hepatic, and adjacent peritoneal surfaces), (2) left upper quadrant (omentum/gastro-colic ligament, spleen, stomach, transverse colon, splenic flexure of colon), (3) pelvis (reproductive organs, recto-sigmoid, pelvic peritoneum), (4) retroperitoneum (pelvic/aortic nodes), and (5) central abdomen (small bowel, ascending/descending colon, mesentery, anterior abdominal wall, pericolic gutters). Survival was analyzed (log rank and Cox regression) on the basis of the rankings at these anatomic regions, the sum of intraabdominal rankings, and the cytoreductive outcome. Overall median and estimated 5-year survivals were 58.2 months and 49%. On univariate analysis, the central abdominal (P = 0.008) and left upper quadrant (P = 0.03) rankings, the sum of rankings (P = 0.01), and the cytoreductive outcome (P &lt;/= 0.0001) influenced survival (log rank).

The aim of this study was to describe USA population-based case-series incidence in the period 1992-1999. Data were retrieved from a Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program public-use file. Incidence rates, male-to-female standardized ratios, estimated annual percentage changes and 5-year relative survival rates were computed, and 6830 malignant carcinoid incident during 1992-1999 were analysed. The overall age-adjusted incidence rates were 1.9 per 100 000 for men and women. There was an excess in women for lung and stomach carcinoids, while rates were higher among men for carcinoids of the small intestine and rectum. From 1992 to 1999, incidence rates showed a 3% estimated annual increase. Thirteen per cent of the cases had metastasis at diagnosis.

The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of colorectal cancer, with particular reference to gender; subsite distribution; stage at diagnosis; tumour grade; the contribution of recognisable aetiological factors; and the resection rate and type of surgery performed for rectal cancer. All 2272 pathology reports of colorectal cancer submitted to the National Cancer Registry for the year 2000 were reviewed and restaged according to the classical Dukes system. Age, gender, stage, subsite distribution, differentiation, tumour type, associated pathology and type of rectal cancer specimen were recorded. The gender ratio for all cases was equal. One third of resected cancers were in the rectum, one third in the left colon and one third were proximal to the splenic flexure. Men had more rectal cancer (M:F 1.6:1) and women more colon cancer (0.9:1). Right-sided cancers were of significantly higher grade than left-sided cancers. The proportion of right-sided cancers increased with advancing age in both men and women. Three per cent of patients had synchronous tumours and 0.2% of patients had phenotypic features of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Fourteen per cent of patients were Dukes stage A at diagnosis, 43% stage B and 43% stage C. Rectal cancers were more likely to be stage A than colon cancers (odds ratio 1.6). Stage and grade of CRC were significantly associated. Ninety one per cent of cancers were resected; 29% of patients with rectal cancer had an abdominoperineal resection and 6% a local excision. The current stage distribution of CRC is in keeping with a predominantly unscreened population. The subsite distribution of cancer and its relationship to age and gender are similar to other high-risk countries; however, its relationship to grade of tumour has not previously been reported. An abdominoperineal resection rate of 29% reflects the mix of specialised colorectal and general surgical units treating rectal cancer in New Zealand and is in line with or better than recent overseas data that reflect national or regional practice.";"2003";"The New Zealand medical journal";"Adenocarcinoma; Adenomatous Polyps; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; New Zealand; Registries; Sex Distribution"

The purpose of this article is to review the outcome of a standardization of all the intraoperative and postoperative processes used in our department for the performance of laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. A consecutive series of patients requiring laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy from March 1999 through December 2001 at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, was analyzed. Patients requiring sigmoid or rectosigmoid resection for all colonic pathologies were included. Criteria for exclusion from an attempted laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy were body mass index &gt;35 and prior major abdominal surgeries (exclusive of hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, or appendectomy). Data collected included age, gender, indication for surgery, American Society of Anesthesiology class, body mass index, operative duration, length of hospital stay, complications, mortality, and 30-day readmission. The operative steps for laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy were as follows: 1) open insertion of the umbilical port; 2) placement of three operating ports; 3) dissection/division of the vascular pedicle after identification of the left ureter; 4) mobilization of the sigmoid and descending colon; 5) rectal mobilization/division; 6) exteriorization of the specimen; and 7) circular stapled anastomosis. Instrumentation for the procedure was standardized. Conversion was performed when a sequential step could not be completed in a reasonable time frame. A standard perioperative care plan was used. From March 1999 through December 2001, the primary surgeon performed 207 sigmoid colectomies, including 181 (87.4 percent) attempted laparoscopic sigmoid colectomies and 22 (12.1 percent) conversions. Indications for the laparoscopic sigmoid colectomies were diverticular disease (115), colonic neoplasia (32), prolapse (14), endometriosis (10), and other (10). The male/female ratio was 85:96, and the mean body mass index was 27.3 +/- 5.6. Mean operative time was 119 +/- 35 minutes. Mean length of stay was 2.9 +/- 1.2 days for completed cases and 6.4 +/- 1.4 days for converted cases. Anastomotic leaks occurred in two patients (1.1 percent), one of whom died of multisystem organ failure, yielding an operative mortality of 0.6 percent. The overall complication rate was 6.6 percent, and the 30-day readmission rate was 8 percent. The results indicate that a structured approach to laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy provides the surgeon with objective measures of operative progress that limit unduly long operations without increasing conversion rates and that control resource utilization. This approach provides a potential guideline for teaching and mastering laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, reducing the learning curve, and optimizing results.";"2003";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Body Mass Index; Colectomy; Colon, Sigmoid; Colonic Diseases; Colonic Neoplasms; Diverticulum, Colon; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Postoperative Care; Retrospective Studies; Sigmoid Diseases; Treatment Outcome"

The aim of the study is to analyze the main etiopathogenetic factors of this complication in the literature and, retrospectively, in personal experience. At the General Surgery Department of the Hospital of Imperia, between September 1997 and August 2001, 278 laparotomic procedures with large bowel anastomosis were completed; 37 patients (13.3%) were treated in emergency. There were 153 males (55%) and 125 females (45%), the average age being 70.5 years (range 41-94). The mean hospital stay was 12 days (range 7-45). The incidence of perioperative mortality was 1.1% (3 cases). Anastomotic leakage occurred in 4 patients (1.4%); one of these died. Analysis of the presented series confirms that factors contributing to leakage of colonic anastomoses are: distal rectum anastomoses, rectal cancer, experience of the surgeon and preoperative radiotherapy. Anastomotic leakage didn't occur in emergency, probably for a prudent attitude that considers multiple-stages surgical procedures in high-risk patients; besides a radical subtotal or total colectomy was performed in the treatment of obstructive cancer of the left colon and rectum. The incidence of anastomotic leakage in colo-rectal surgery was lower when anastomoses were performed in ideal circumstances; it is necessary to know the main risk factors to reduce this complication.";"2003";"Minerva chirurgica";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Colon; Emergencies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Rectum; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surgical Wound Dehiscence"

How is it produced? Who is defining it? How compulsory is it? A standard should only be understood as guiding principles or as following guidelines and never as a dogma, while otherwise every operative technical or therapeutical progress is prohibited. On the basis of the onco-surgical guidelines for the colo-rectal carcinoma is shown how standards can begin to sway. The Turnbull &quot;no-touch isolation technique&quot; does not stand up to the criteria of the evidence based medicine. The usefulness of the high ligation of the veins and the intestinal occlusion has not been proven by any studies. The central ligature of the Arteria mesenterica inferior in left resection is wrong according more recent anatomical knowledge. Ligation near to the aorta leads obligatory to lesions of the plexus hypogastricus. Animal experiments are controversial concerning the dissemination of tumour cells during crushing of the cancer. And a prospective controlled study does not show any advantage of respecting the Turnbull criteria. Independent prognostic factors are the surgeon, the frequency of performing the procedure in the hospital concerned, the pT and N stage, the R-0 resection and according to American pathologists the pre-operative CEA titre. Also are mentioned the infiltration of veins and lymph vessels, micro metastases in lymph nodes and the grading. The resection should if possible be performed in anatomical layers, specially considering the meso-rectum. What should be done in the distal 8 cm till the pelvic floor has not yet been clarified. On the contrary, the laparoscopic surgery has definitively also found its acceptance in oncological surgery. The discussions about port-metastases and tumour-cell-dissemination by the pneumoperitoneum-gas have silenced. Already, partially better long-term results are mentioned. In the beginning of 2003, the pillars of the standard technique of oncological colo-rectal surgery are besides the orthograde intestinal flushing, the pre-operative low molecular Heparin and the antibiotic prophylaxis, the open or laparoscopic R-0 en bloc resection, the minimal safety distance in the low rectum of 1 cm, the ligature of the Arteria mesenterica inferior 2-3 cm distally to its origin from the aorta in case of left resection, respectively the Arteria ilio-colica at its origin from the Arteria mesenterica superior in case of right resection, the cytotoxic intestinal flushing in case of left resection and the flushing of the abdominal cavity as well as the port-site with Taurolin 0.5%.

Before 1997, only patients with early (Tis or T1) cancers located in the rectosigmoid and upper rectum that required bowel resection were candidates for laparoscopy. In 1997, we expanded the application of laparoscopy to include T2 cancers located anywhere in the rectum. Mesorectal transection was performed at least 5 cm below the tumor for rectosigmoidal and upper rectal lesions, and total mesorectal excision was performed for lower tumors. Primary anastomosis was performed by a double-stapling technique, or a handsewn coloanal anastomosis was performed. Patient demographics and outcomes were recorded prospectively. The median follow-up was 23 months. An anastomosis was performed in 92.9 percent of the operations. Oral intake was started on median postoperative Day 1, and the median length of hospitalization was 8 days. Two patients needed conversion to conventional open surgery. A total of 15 postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (18.6 percent), including anastomotic leakage in 6 (8.6 percent) and bowel obstruction in 3 (4.3 percent). Reoperation was required in six patients. Two patients developed recurrence of cancer at the anastomotic site.

Most general complications occurred in the cardiorespiratory system. In 9 patients reoperation was necessary. Eight patients (5 per cent) died in the postoperative period. In patients with extended gastrectomy significantly more complications occurred--compared with gastrectomy + omentectomy only. This could also be observed in patients with only splenectomy. If more organs were removed or resected with total gastrectomy and splenectomy, the complication rate increased only if pancreatic resection was performed.

The 4 most commonly used routes for resection and replacement include a transhiatal, transthoracic (Ivor-Lewis), tri-incisional (right chest then simultaneous abdominal and left neck), and left chest (distal tumors). Each of these techniques will be described as will the use of colon and jejunum for esophageal replacement. The healthy stomach is the preferred conduit for esophageal replacement. The stomach is well vascularized, easily reaches to the neck, and requires only a single anastomosis for re-establishing intestinal continuity. When the stomach is not available (usually because of prior surgery or disease) the choice of conduits include colon and jejunum. With respect to minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, several groups have significant experience with this and report excellent results. This is an evolving technique but holds much promise for improving the quality of life of patients with cancer without compromising their survival. In locally advanced middle third tumors, thoracotomy and dissection under direct vision's desirable and improves the safety of the operation. The same may apply to tumors receiving neoadjuvant therapy. For tumors of the distal esophagus, transhiatal, tri-incisional, and Ivor-Lewis resection are probably equally as safe, and appear to result in equivalent long-term survival. An intrathoracic anastomotic leak is disastrous, carrying a mortality rate of up to 50%. Any surgeon who performs esophagectomy with an intrathoracic anastomosis must do so with a low incidence of leakage, certainly under 5%. Consideration should be given to a cervical placement if there are factors increasing the risk such as the use of induction therapy.";"2003";"Minerva chirurgica";"Colon; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagectomy; Esophagus; Humans; Jejunum"

Together with observations that tumours in the hereditary cancer syndromes HNPCC and FAP occur predominantly in the right and left colon, respectively, the existence of 2 categories of CRC based on site of origin in the large bowel was proposed more than a decade ago. Differences between normal right and left colonic segments that could favour progression through different tumourigenic pathways are summarized in this review. Accumulating evidence suggests that the risk of CRC conferred by various environmental and genetic factors is different for proximal and distal tumours. Right- and left-sided tumours also exhibit different sensitivities to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Such differences are probably related to the molecular characteristics of the tumours, with the microsatellite instability and CpG island methylator phenotypes being associated with right-sided tumours and chromosomal instability with left-sided tumours. Future molecular-based classification systems for CRC that rely upon distinctive gene expression patterns may allow a clearer discrimination of subgroups than that provided by tumour site alone. Until then however, the existence of 2 broadly different groups of cancer defined by site of origin in the colon should be considered in the design of future epidemiologic studies as well as in the design of new clinical trials aimed at testing novel adjuvant therapies.";"2002";"International journal of cancer";"Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Rectal Neoplasms"

The study included 135 patients with sCRC who were followed up for a median of 72 months. Multiple fresh-frozen fragments obtained from superficial and invasive areas of the tumors were mixed and used to detect the degree of DNA aneuploidy (DNA index [DI]) and S-phase fraction by two scatter signals and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-2-hydrocloride (DAPI) fluorescence flow cytometry (FCM).

Univariate analyses of overall survival with both Dukes' A to D or B to C series of cases showed that DNA multiple aneuploidy, k-ras2 mutations, older age, and distal site, but not increased S-phase fraction, were predictive of worse outcome. Multivariate Cox models strongly indicated that k-ras2 mutations, but neither single nor multiple DNA aneuploidy, were an independent prognostic factor in both series of patients.

Obstruction site was the left colon in 82.5% and the sigmoid in 66% of patients from western region, and 91.7% (p = 0.03), and 85% (p = 0.007) respectively of those from eastern region. The leading causes of obstruction were obstructive cancer (52.5%) in Istanbul and volvulus (80.2%) Van respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The colonic obstruction was complicated in 22% of patients. The rate of complicated obstruction was 17.5% and 26.4% (p = 0.07) in Van respectively. The overall postoperative mortality was found as 12.9%. The mortality being 8.6% in simple obstruction raised to 28% (p = 0.008) in complicated patients. We found significant differences in colonic obstruction cases between eastern and western parts of Turkey. The incidence of complicated obstruction is bigger in eastern region. A considerable mortality arises in surgically treated patients with colonic obstruction.

With the markedly improved life expectancy, many CF patients are now adults. There is an associated increased risk of certain colonic disorders, and the emergence of other previously unrecognized disorders, in adult CF patients. The distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), which is more common in older patients, is a frequent cause of abdominal pain. Intussusception may complicate DIOS; other differential diagnoses include appendiceal disease, volvolus, Crohn's disease, fibrosing colonopathy and colonic carcinoma. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis, although uncommon in patients with CF, is often delayed, and appendiceal abscess is a frequent complication. The prevalence of Crohn's disease in CF has been shown to be 17 times that of the general population. Right-sided microscopic colitis is a recently recognized entity in CF of uncertain clinical significance. Fibrosing colonopathy has been confined mostly to children with CF, attributed to the use of high strength pancreatic enzyme supplements, but it has been reported in three adults. Nine cases of carcinoma of the large intestine have been reported worldwide, associated with an apparent excess risk of digestive tract cancers in CF. Despite high carrier rates of Clostridium difficile in patients with CF, pseudomembranous colitis is distinctly rare, but severe cases complicated by toxic megacolon have been reported. In these patients, watery diarrhea is often absent.

A 72-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital, with pain in the right groin and buttock. The pain had appeared 6 months before admission, and the symptoms had then been relieved by oral antibiotics. On March 25, 1999, inflammatory signs in the right buttock indicated localized cellulitis, and incision and drainage was performed at a local hospital. The patient was referred to our hospital on the same day. On admission to our hospital, computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a thick right-sided colonic wall and enlargement of the right ileopsoas muscle. Barium enema and colonofiberscopy revealed an ulcerated tumor occupying the entire circumference of the cecum. A retroperitoneal abscess and fistula had been formed by the retroperitoneal perforation of cecum carcinoma: surgical resection was performed after remission of the local inflammatory signs. Operative findings indicated that the cancerous lesion and its surrounding tissues were firmly attached to the right iliopsoas and major psoas muscle, and en-bloc resection, including adjacent muscular tissue, was performed.

We investigated whether the improved prognosis for these cancers is related to the content of activated cytotoxic intraepithelial T lymphocytes. Microsatellite instability and the amount of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes were analyzed according to clinicopathological features, survival, and disease recurrence in 109 right-sided colon carcinomas from 245 consecutive patients with stage II/III colon cancer that underwent radical surgery. High-frequency microsatellite instability was found in 43% of stage II/III proximal colon cancers and was associated with significantly higher numbers of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes. High-frequency microsatellite instability, as well as the content of intratumoral-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes correlated with improved overall and disease-free survival, particularly in patients with stage III tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with both features had a risk of death and relapse markedly lower than that associated with microsatellite status or intratumoral cytotoxic lymphocytes separately. The presence of local cytotoxic immune responses is probably the major determinant of the good clinical course of patients with microsatellite unstable colon cancer. Furthermore, high-frequency microsatellite instability coupled with a high content of intratumoral cytotoxic lymphocytes may identify a subset of colon cancer patients with a favorable clinical outcome, particularly in stage III disease.";"2001";"The American journal of pathology";"Aged; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Phenotype; Prognosis; Survival Analysis; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"

Based on our own experience reconstructive laparoscopy as well as with open retropubic radical prostatectomy we have used a combined ascending/descending technique similar to open surgery. In this paper we want to describe our approach and to present the initial results with the Heilbronn technique. A transperitoneal approach is used with a W-shaped arrangement of the trocars (13-mm umbilical port, 2 x 10 mm medial, 2 x 5 mm lateral ports). After the exposure of the Retzius' space and control of the dorsal vein complex the urethra is incised and the distal pedicles of the prostate (+/- the neurovascular bundle) are transsected. We now pull the apex ventrally and start with the incision at the bladder neck followed by a transvesical access to both vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles. The gland is entrapped in the Extraction Bag. After accomplishing the posterior wall of the urethrovesical anastomosis with five interrupted sutures, the foley catheter is placed into the bladder and the bladder neck is closed. Now the prostate is extracted via the umbilical incision. From March 1999 to June 2000, we have performed 100 cases (48 pT2-, 47 pT3- and 5 pT4 tumors). The mean preoperative PSA was 26.8 (1.4-75.5) ng/ml. Two tumors were grade 1, 72 grade 2 and 26 grade 3. Median Gleason score was 6 (3-9). All specimen were inked and examined according to the Stanford protocol. Postoperative continence was evaluated using a questionnaire monitored by a colleague who was involved in surgery. We had 5 conversions (rectal injury, difficult dissection, adhesion, 2x bleeding at the dorsal vein complex). The mean operating time was 278 (180-500) min., the transfusion rate 31%. One patient required reintervention due to bleeding from the right obturator fossa. 95% of the patients did not require any analgesia on the second postoperative day. Positive margins were found in 17% of the patients, of which 12 had a PSA nadir to a value of less than 0.1 ng/ml within 3 weeks after surgery. In 82 patients, the anastomosis was tight after removal of the catheter, median catheter time was 8 (6-30) days. 4% developed a stricture at the anastomotic site which could be treated by laser incision. On discharge 33% were continent, after 6 months 81%, whereas only 2 patients still suffer from grade II stress incontinence at 9 months. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is feasible but requires laparoscopic expertise. Its learning curve is still ongoing.

Peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) is a side-effect of many anticancer agents used in routine practice. Oxaliplatin is a relatively new agent currently licensed in over 50 countries including France, Germany and the UK for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Although it is a new agent, it is from the same family of drugs as cisplatin, an agent that has been used for many years. PSN is the most commonly discussed side-effect associated with oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin-induced PSN is characterized by two distinct syndromes: a transient acute dysaesthesia and a cumulative distal neurotoxicity. Importantly, both are generally reversible after stopping treatment. Oxaliplatin-induced acute PSN is triggered and exacerbated by cold and can be greatly reduced in affected patients simply by avoiding cold conditions. Oxaliplatin-induced cumulative PSN may also be managed by temporary cessation of treatment.";"2002";"International journal of palliative nursing";"Antineoplastic Agents; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Humans; Organoplatinum Compounds; Oxaliplatin; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases"

Traditionally, different approaches have been used in the management of right-sided and left-sided colonic obstruction. Recently, single-stage resection with primary anastomosis in left colonic obstruction has been shown to have good results. The objective of this study was to compare the operative results of patients who had emergency operations for right-sided and left-sided obstructions from primary colorectal cancers. This is a retrospective study including 243 patients who underwent emergency operations for obstructing colorectal cancers from 1989 to 1997. Primary resection of the tumor-bearing segment followed by primary anastomosis was attempted when the conditions were feasible. The operative results of patients with right-sided tumors were compared with those of patients with left-sided tumors. One hundred seven patients had obstruction at or proximal to the splenic flexure (right-sided lesions), and 136 had lesions distal to the splenic flexure (left-sided lesions). The primary resection rate was 91.8%. Of the 223 patients with primary resection, primary anastomosis was possible in 197 patients. Among the 101 primary anastomoses in patients with left-sided obstruction, segmental resection with on-table lavage was performed in 75 patients and subtotal colectomy was performed in 26. The overall operative mortality rate was 9.4%, although that of the patients with primary resection and anastomosis was 8.1%. The anastomotic leakage rate for those with primary resection and anastomosis was 6.1%. There were no differences in the mortality or leakage rates between patients with right-sided and left-sided lesions (mortality: 7.3% versus 8.9%, p = 0.79; leakage: 5.2% versus 6.9%, p = 0.77). Colocolonic anastomosis did not show a significant difference in leakage rate when compared with ileocolonic anastomosis (6.1% versus 6.0%, p = 1.0). This study showed that primary resection and anastomosis for left-sided malignant obstruction, either by segmental resection with on-table lavage or subtotal colectomy, was not more hazardous than primary anastomosis for right-sided obstruction. The single-stage procedure should be the objective for the treatment of patients with obstructing colorectal cancers, except when patients are hemodynamically unstable during surgery or when the condition of the bowel is not optimal for primary anastomosis.";"2001";"Journal of the American College of Surgeons";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Colectomy; Colonic Diseases; Colorectal Neoplasms; Emergencies; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Therapeutic Irrigation; Treatment Outcome"

Recently, preoperative low-dose radiotherapy has been shown to improve both local recurrence rate and overall survival. Down-staging of locally advanced tumors, however, requires preoperative doses of at least 50 to 60 Gy. Most experimental studies investigating the effect of preoperative radiotherapy have made use of a single dose or a limited number of fractionated doses. Moreover, in most studies, both limbs of the anastomosis were irradiated, in contrast to clinical practice, in which one limb of the anastomosis consists of nonirradiated bowel. We studied the effect of a fractionated, clinically relevant scheme of high-dose preoperative radiotherapy on colonic anastomotic healing in the rat. Male Wistar rats randomly received 0, 40, 60, or 80 Gy of preoperative radiotherapy on one limb of the anastomosis only. Radiotherapy doses were validated with implanted dosimeters; before the start of radiotherapy, the cecum was fixed outside the radiation field. A clinically used fractionation scheme of 2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 4 to 8 weeks was used. The day after radiotherapy completion, a side-to-side colorectal anastomosis was performed. Rats were killed 10 days after surgery. The following parameters were determined: presence of abscess or peritonitis, anastomotic complications (stenosis, leak, or dehiscence), intestinal obstruction, anastomotic bursting pressure, and anastomotic hydroxyproline content. No significant differences were found in peritonitis rate, anastomotic complications, anastomotic bursting pressure, or hydroxyproline content. Irradiated animals gained weight more slowly than the control group. In this rat model, preoperative high-dose radiotherapy using a clinically relevant fractionation scheme does not affect outcome or anastomotic healing when only one limb of the anastomosis is irradiated.";"2001";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Anastomosis, Surgical; Animals; Colonic Neoplasms; Male; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasms, Experimental; Peritonitis; Postoperative Complications; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Wound Healing"

Therefore, in this study, we examined whether there is a valid association between the p53 alterations and the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients, especially distal colorectal cancer cases. Tumor samples were collected from 110 patients resected for colorectal cancer between 1989 and 1997. The entire coding region of the p53 gene was analyzed by automated direct sequencing. In addition, the DO-7 monoclonal antibody was used in the immunohistochemical (IHC) assessments. By the Cox univariate analyses in all tumors, Dukes' stage, lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis, p53 mutation and p53 protein overexpression were significant predictors of survival. The cases without p53 mutation showed significantly improved prognosis compared to the cases with p53 mutation (p = 0.0085). In distal tumors, Dukes' stage, liver metastasis, p53 mutation and p53 protein overexpression were significant predictors of survival. Multivariate analysis of all tumors, p53 mutation and liver metastasis were independent indicators of poor survival (p = 0.0223 for p53 mutation, p = 0.0254 for liver metastasis). Also in distal tumors, p53 mutation was an independent indicator (p = 0.0011). Furthermore, the relative risk associated with p53 mutation in distal tumors was much higher than that in all tumors (8.260 vs. 1.796). However, p53 protein overexpression was not an independent indicator of survival in all tumors as well as distal tumors (p = 0.1918 in all tumors, p = 0.0607 in distal tumors). In proximal tumors, p53 mutation was not an independent indicator (p = 0.6673).

There were 33 patients, 22 in CO group and 11 in LA group. The groups were comparable for age, sex, tumour and anastomotic heights from anal verge, stage of disease, length of specimen removed and duration of surgery. Incisions were significantly shorter in the LA group (median, 9 cm vs. 16 cm, p = 0.01). Less parenteral analgesia was required in the LA group (2 days vs. 3 days, p = 0.05), but there were no significant differences in the time to passage of flatus, commencement of oral fluids or solid foods and length of hospital stay.

The anastomoses have been performed in end-to-end fashion (11 patients), according to the Knight's technique (2 cases) or in side-to-end fashion (2 patients). As most frequent associated technique with stapled anastomoses, anterior rectal resection for cancer was performed with 2 cm of clearance beyond the macroscopic margin of tumor. Distal margin of resection was histologically verified and it proved to be free of tumor cells. There was no operative mortality. Anastomotic leakage occurred in three patients because of imperfection of stapled anastomosis (2 cases) or after local irradiation (1 case). Spontaneous closure was seen in one patients. The other two patients needed reoperation for suture or colostomy. Late clinical, endoscopic and X-ray controls did not discover local recurrences. Functional results were good in terms of stool frequency and continence. In conclusion, stapled fashioned anastomoses have the main indication in sphincter saving Dixon's and Hartmann's procedures. In these cases, stapled anastomoses are easier than manual technique, reduce operative time and improve suture reliability.";"2003";"Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)";"Adenocarcinoma; Anastomosis, Surgical; Colonic Polyps; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Surgical Stapling; Treatment Outcome"

The purpose of this study was to review the histology and clinical course of the largest series of cases ever reported from a single center on this rare condition. The Mayo Clinic tissue registry was searched for all primary cases of squamous and adenosquamous carcinoma of the colon or rectum proximal to 8 cm from the dentate and presenting before December 31, 1992. Of the 52 identified cases there was adequate histologic material for review in 44 cases. These cases were divided into pure squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 11), mixed adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 31), and adenocarcinoma with benign-appearing squamous metaplasia (adenoacanthoma; n = 2). Squamous-cell carcinomas were examined for evidence of human papilloma virus by in situ hybridization. A retrospective review of medical records was undertaken in all 52 cases with respect to predisposing factors, clinicopathologic behavior, prognostic features, and treatment with adjuvant therapy. The charts of 52 patients (20 females), with a mean age of 58.6 (range, 19-90) years, were reviewed. Right-sided lesions were the most common (43 percent). Metastatic disease was evident at presentation in 49 percent of patients, the most common sites in order being liver, peritoneal, and lung. The five-year overall survival rate was 34 percent, Stage I to III disease had a 65 percent five-year survival rate, and Stage IV mean survival time was 8.5 months. For node-positive and node-negative disease, 23 and 85 percent, respectively, survived five years. There was no evidence of human papilloma virus in the six squamous-cell carcinomas examined. Squamous and adenosquamous carcinomas of the colon and rectum are rare neoplasms. Although a poor prognosis can be expected for node-positive disease, patients with negative nodes do generally the same as patients with adenocarcinoma histology. Based on advances made with multimodality therapy of squamous-cell cancer of the anus and adenocarcinoma of the rectum, further studies should define the role of postoperative therapies for these lesions.";"2001";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Adenosquamous; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate"

We hypothesized that older age, female gender, and the presence of comorbid illness would be associated with proximal cancers. Incident cases of colorectal cancer (n = 9,550) occurring in 1994 were identified from Florida's population-based statewide cancer registry. We categorized colorectal cancers as either proximal (cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon) or distal (descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid, and rectum). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the multivariable relationship between clinical characteristics and the odds of a proximal-occurring lesion. Four characteristics emerged as independent predictors of a proximal lesion. Each year of increasing age was associated with a 2.2 percent increase in the odds of a proximal lesion, whereas female gender was associated with a 38 percent increase in the odds of a proximal lesion. The presence of a comorbid condition was associated with a 28 percent greater odds of a proximal lesion, and, finally, black, non-Hispanic race was associated with a 24 percent greater odds of a proximal lesion. We found that increasing age, female gender, black, non-Hispanic race, and the presence of comorbid illnesses were factors associated with a greater likelihood of developing colorectal cancer in a proximal location. Further studies will be required to confirm these findings and to establish the mechanism by which comorbidity influences the site of colorectal cancer development.";"2001";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"African Continental Ancestry Group; Age Factors; Colorectal Neoplasms; Comorbidity; Female; Florida; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Registries; Risk Factors; Sex Factors"

Eleven patients had symptomatic unresectable pelvic recurrent rectal cancer. The mean +/- SD product of the 2 maximum perpendicular diameters of the recurrent cancer was 24.2 +/- 11.0 cm(2) (range, 10-48 cm(2)). Tumor fixation to the pelvic side walls or proximal sacrum were the main criteria for unresectability. All patients were free from extrapelvic disease and had a life expectancy longer than 3 months. Patients were submitted to one course of pelvic perfusion with mitomycin C (MMC) (25 mg/m(2)) by means of a simplified balloon occlusion technique. A pharmacokinetic evaluation of the procedure was also performed. Response rate and time to disease progression were the primary endpoints; overall survival was the secondary endpoint. Mean +/- SD value of the ratios of pelvic MMC area under the plasma concentration curve (0 to 20 minutes) (AUC(0-20)) to systemic MMC AUC(0-20) was 13.30 +/- 6.52. During the procedures there were no technical, hemodynamic, or vascular complications, and no deaths occurred during surgery or in the postoperative period. The response rate was 36.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.5%-66.1%). Pain response rate was 45.4% (95% CI, 16.6%-76.2%). Median survival was 12.2 months (range, 5.7-19.5 months).

Age-standardized incidence, mortality and survival rates for CRC, based on data from the National Cancer Intelligence Centre at the Office for National Statistics, were calculated and trends assessed. Between 1971 and 1997 the total number of cases of CRC increased by 42%, from 20,400 to 28,900. The site distribution of CRC between 1971 and 1994 was: rectum 38%, sigmoid 29%, caecum 15%, transverse colon and flexures 10%, ascending colon 5%, and descending colon 3%. Between 1971 and 1997 the direct age-standardized incidence increased by 20% in males and by 5% in females. The direct age-standardized mortality fell by 24% in males and by 37% in females. Age-standardized relative 5-year survival in adults improved from 22%-27% for patients diagnosed during 1971-1975 to over 40% for those diagnosed during the period 1991-1993. In conclusion, the incidence of CRC in England and Wales has been steadily rising. It is more common in males and has increased more rapidly in males than in females.

Colorectal resection was performed about 32 days after the end of the radiotherapy. The distal colon stump was pulled through the anal canal. On postoperative day 5 the colonic stump was resected and a direct coloanal anastomosis performed without colostomia diversion. There was no mortality. There was no leakage. One patient had a pelvic abscess. One patient had a necrosis of the left colon requiring reoperation. Another delayed coloanal anastomosis could be performed. Median followup was 43 months (range 6 to 113 months). Functional results were evaluated with a new scoring system including 13 items.

The technique of colon resection through an open laparotomy incision is well known. Over the past several years, laparoscopically assisted colectomy has been developed and studied, following the explosion of laparoscopic technology from the cholecystectomy experience and with acquisition of advanced general laparoscopic techniques. The right, left or sigmoid colon can be mobilized and regional lymphadenectomy performed using laparoscopic instruments and video-imaging equipment. The advantage of laparoscopic colectomy is the use of small abdominal port site and wound incisions which translate to reduced postoperative pain and analgesic requirement, earlier return of bowel function and normal physical activities, and shorter hospital stay without increasing health care costs. Laparoscopic colectomy compares favorably with open colectomy in terms of surgical morbidity and mortality. The laparoscopic approach has been shown to be technically and oncologically feasible with equivalent lymph node harvest from mesenteric lymphadenectomy and achieves adequate proximal and distal margins of colonic resection. Despite initial early anecdotal reports of port site cancer recurrence in laparoscopically assisted colectomy, port site recurrence is rare and its incidence is similar to incisional recurrences in conventional open colectomy. Recent prospective comparative studies have demonstrated equivalent patient survival and equivalent local or distant colon cancer recurrences for open versus laparoscopic curative resection of colon cancer.";"2001";"Surgical oncology";"Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Feasibility Studies; Health Care Costs; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Lymph Node Excision; Morbidity; Quality of Life; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome"

The objective of this work was to explore the existence of possible differences in the informative weight of the risk of tumor recurrence provided by p53 immunostaining depending on the localization of the neoplasm. Nuclear immunohistochemical expression of p53 protein was determined in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tumor tissue samples from 190 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas. The relative prognostic importance on the risk of recurrence of each variable was assessed in a Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. Multiplicative interaction terms between p53 and tumor site were included in the multivariate models in order to test their joint effect on survival. One hundred and one patients (53.1%) manifested nuclear accumulation of the protein. P53 overexpression was more frequent in distal than in proximal tumors (58.5% ve s 41.7%) (p = 0.03). Disease-free survival was lower in p53-positive cases (75% versus 38%) (p = 0.006), but significance of the association varied according to the localization of the tumor (p = 0.004 in proximal carcinomas and p = 0.049 in distal carcinomas). Multivariate analysis identified p53 positivity and distal tumor localization as the factors significantly associated with a high risk of recurrence Interaction between p53 expression and localization was present. P53 exhibited different prognostic value in distal and proximal colon. While adjusted hazard ratio for positive p53 was 1.99 in distal cancers, it was 8.04 for proximal tumors. The prognostic with value of tumor recurrence associated overexpression of p53 protein is influenced by the location of the tumor. The negative predictive weight is significantly higher in proximal than in distal cancers.";"2001";"Anticancer research";"Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Nucleus; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Rectal Neoplasms; Recurrence; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"

We identified 37 cases at our institution between 1980 and 1996. They comprised 0.48 percent of all cases of colon malignancies (37/7,658) during this period. The following clinical information was obtained: age, gender, signs and symptoms, tumor site, tumor size, histology grade, pathology, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were abdominal pain (62 percent), abdominal mass (54 percent), and weight loss (43 percent). The most frequent site of involvement was the cecum (45 percent). Histologically, 29 (78 percent) were classified as high-grade, and 8 (22 percent) as intermediate-grade-to-low-grade lymphoma. Nine (24.3 percent) of the cases were Stage EI, 23 (62.2 percent) were Stage EII, and 5 (13.5 percent) were Stage EIV. Twenty-one (57 percent) cases received adjuvant chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate was 33 percent for all patients and 39 percent for patients treated with combination chemotherapy. Overall median survival time was 24 months and 36 months for those with adjuvant chemotherapy. Only histology grade, among the factors examined, was a significant prognostic factor for survival. The mean survival time of the patients with Stage II disease who received chemotherapy was 117.4 months, and it was 47.9 months for the patients with Stage II disease who did not received chemotherapy. In our retrospective study high-grade lymphoma was the only significant adverse prognostic factor for survival.

This study was undertaken to determine the oncological adequacy, in terms of margins of resection, lymph node harvest, and anastomotic and locoregional recurrence of laparoscopic colectomy in patients with stage III (node-positive) colorectal cancer. The results of laparoscopic colectomy in 50 consecutive patients with stage III colorectal cancer operated on at a single hospital between 1991 and 1998 were analyzed with respect to postoperative morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival by the Kaplan-Meier method. Methodical patient follow-up was the mainstay of the study. There were 31 men (52%) and 19 women (38%) with a mean age of 67.7 years (range, 40-88). Low anterior resection was performed in 17 cases, abdominal perineal resection in five cases sigmoid colectomy in 10 cases, left hemicolectomy in six cases, right hemicolectomy in seven cases, transverse colectomy in one case, and subtotal colectomy in four cases. Conversion was necessary in three cases (6%). Major complications included one leak, one pelvic abscess, one perineal wound infection, and three anastomotic strictures early in the experience, with none in the past 4 years. One early death occurred due to massive stroke. Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 3-37). Forty-six patients were staged as CII and four as CI colon cancer. The average number of positive nodes was 5.1 (range, 3-58). The margins of resection were adequate in all patients. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 75 months (average, 29.3; median, 24). Overall cancer-related mortality was 34% (17 patients); three patients died of unrelated causes with no detectable cancer. All who died of cancer had distant disease; three of them also had pelvic recurrence. Mean time of death was 21.7 months. There were no anastomotic recurrences or trocar site implants. Overall 3- and 5-year survival was 54.5% and 38.5%, respectively; cancer-adjusted survival was 60.8% and 49.1%. Based on this study, laparoscopic colectomy in patients with stage III colorectal cancer is oncologically adequate. It results in a long-term outcome comparable to that of traditional open surgery and is associated with low perioperative mortality and morbidity (lower wound infection rate, lower wound recurrences at trocar sites) and a shortened length of stay.";"2001";"Surgical endoscopy";"Adult; Aged; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Survival Rate; Time Factors"

However, isolated metastases do occur that may be curable with adrenalectomy. Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) can differentiate benign from malignant pathology and isolated from disseminated metastases. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PET scanning can influence the outcome of adrenalectomy for metastatic disease. We conducted a retrospective review of eight patients undergoing adrenalectomy for presumed isolated metastatic disease from 1985 through 1997. The patients included six women and two men with an average age of 58 (range, 36-74). Their primary tumors were six lung carcinomas, one renal cell carcinoma, and one colon carcinoma. The adrenal masses were located on the right in six patients, on the left in one, and bilaterally in one. Before operation, all patients were evaluated by chest and abdominal CT. Four patients were also evaluated by PET scan. Six right, one left, and one bilateral adrenalectomies were performed. Associated organ resections included two right partial nephrectomies and one right total nephrectomy, one left partial nephrectomy, two distal pancreatectomies, one splenectomy, and two partial hepatic resections. All eight patients survived operation. There were no major perioperative complications, but one patient required readmission for congestive heart failure. Three of the four patients who did not have PET scanning died from 4 to 48 months after operation with disseminated disease from lung, colon, and renal carcinoma respectively. The remaining patient who did not have PET scanning is alive and well 11 years later. Two of the four patients who had PET scans showing isolated disease are alive at 28 and 43 months after operation, whereas the other two died of disseminated disease at 29 and 36 months after operation. We conclude that 1) adrenalectomy can provide survival benefit in patients with isolated metastases, and 2) PET scanning is useful in confirming isolated metastatic disease and selecting patients for adrenalectomy.";"2000";"The American surgeon";"Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Adrenalectomy; Adult; Aged; Animals; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Selection; Survival Rate; Tomography, Emission-Computed"

Investigation of the occurrence of mutations in 88 colorectal cancer patients' specimens using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is reported: age: 61.9 years (27-80), gender: 48 male, 42 female, Dukes' stages: 43 at B, 35 at C, 10 at D, primary of tumour: 52 colon, 36 rectal adenocarcinoma. Mutation of one of the three ras-codons was detectable in the 54 cases, more frequently at the Dukes' stage C (p &lt; 0.05). The ras-mutation correlated to a more elevated death-rate in the Dukes' B and C stages (p &lt; 0.01). Mean survival time and time to progression were significantly longer at the Dukes' stage B if mutation was not detected (p &lt; 0.01). The genetic alteration occurred significantly more frequently at tumours of the right-side colon, than the left side (p &lt; 0.02) or rectum (p &lt; 0.05). However, in the age group of 41-50 years, it was more significantly identified in the cases of rectal cancer (p &lt; 0.01). At the age of 51-60 years mutations were detected in men at a higher rate (p &lt; 0.05). The mutation of the codon 13 appeared more frequently in the cases of local recurrences (p &lt; 0.05). The occurrence of the ras-oncogene is a sign of an extremely malignant potential of tumour. This fact manifested itself in the time to progression and mean survival time of patients at the same clinical or pathological stage. The higher frequency of genetic alterations at the proximal colon may be the reason for more unfavourable prognosis of the disease localised to this site. Reconstructing the molecular events, the presence of the ras mutation proved to be an important element for prognosis of the disease and should be a basis of potentially individualised therapeutic intervention.";"2000";"Anticancer research";"Biomarkers, Tumor; Codon; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Genes, ras; Genetic Markers; Humans; Male; Mutation; Prognosis; Survival Analysis"

The purpose of the present study was to define the clinical, pathologic, and management issues in patients with abdominal wall metastases from colorectal cancer. Patients presenting to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer were entered into a prospective database beginning in 1986. Review of this database showed that 31 patients presenting with recurrent disease in the abdominal wall were managed surgically at the institution between 1986 and 1998. A total of 31 patients (19 males) with a median age of 67 (range, 45-86) years presented with recurrent disease between 7 and 183 (median, 24) months after primary surgery. Primary tumors were located in the right colon in 17 patients, left colon in 2 patients, sigmoid colon in 7 patients, and rectum in 3 patients. Nineteen percent of primary tumors were perforated, 45 percent were poorly differentiated, 92 percent were transmural (T3 or T4), and 51 percent had lymph node metastases at presentation. Twenty-two patients presented with a symptomatic abdominal wall mass, whereas recurrence in the abdominal wall was found incidentally in 9 patients undergoing laparotomy. Four patients had isolated abdominal wall disease, whereas the remaining 27 were found to have associated intra-abdominal disease. Six patients who were left with residual intra-abdominal cancer after abdominal wall resection had a median survival time of four months. Twenty-five patients underwent a histologically complete resection of recurrence restricted to the abdominal wall alone (n = 4; median survival time, 18 months), abdominal wall and in continuity resection of adherent viscera (n = 15; median survival time, 12.5 months), or resection of abdominal wall and intra-abdominal recurrence at a distant site (n = 6; median survival time, 22 months, although only 1 patient remained alive with disease). The actual two-year and five-year disease-free survival rates were 16 and 3 percent, respectively.

Neostigmine enhances excitatory parasympathetic activity by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetylcholinesterase at sites of cholinergic transmission and enhancing cholinergic action. We hypothesized that neostigmine would restore peristalsis in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. Twenty-eight patients at Fletcher Allen Health Care and The Cleveland Clinic Foundation were treated for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with neostigmine 2.5 mg IV over 3 minutes while being monitored with telemetry. Mechanical obstruction had been excluded. Complete clinical resolution of large bowel distention occurred in 26 of the 28 patients. Time to pass flatus varied from 30 seconds to 10 minutes after administration of neostigmine. No adverse effects or complications were noted. Of the two patients who did not resolve, one had a sigmoid cancer that required resection and one patient died from multiorgan failure. This study supports the theory that acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is the result of excessive parasympathetic suppression rather than sympathetic overactivity.

If it causes a single abscess, it may be successfully cured by percutaneous drainage, but in case of extensive peritoneal infection (multiple abscesses and generalized peritonitis), it is associated with a 40 to 60 percent mortality. This study aimed at evaluating aggressive, one-stage surgical management in such cases. All patients referred to our surgical intensive care unit during the past ten years with generalized, multilocular, intra-abdominal sepsis after anterior resection were reviewed. There were 32 patients, with a mean age of 65 years, among which 15 (47 percent) were referred from other institutions. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on admission was 18. All patients underwent a laparotomy with complete peritoneal exploration, intraoperative lavage, fecal diversion, capillary drainage of the pelvis excluding the rectal stump or the leaking anastomosis from the peritoneal cavity, and primary closure of the abdomen. A Hartmann's operation was done in 22 cases, and conservation of the anastomosis with proximal colostomy was done in 10 cases. The choice was based on the size of the leak, the viability of the colon, and the site of the anastomosis. Four patients died (12 percent), and five patients (16 percent) had recurrent sepsis. When the anastomosis had been conserved, restoration of continuity was achieved in all cases. After Hartmann's operation 8 patients of 19 survivors kept a permanent stoma; 7 had undergone a low anterior resection. Extensive intra-abdominal infection after anterior resection may be efficiently controlled by a surgical approach combining peritoneal debridement, fecal diversion, and capillary drainage of the pelvis. Intestinal continuity may be restored after diversion stoma or Hartmann's procedure after high anterior resection. This is not the case after a Hartmann's operation after a low colorectal anastomosis, and this procedure should be avoided whenever possible.";"2000";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Abdominal Abscess; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Colectomy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Colostomy; Debridement; Drainage; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Peritonitis; Reoperation; Surgical Instruments; Surgical Wound Dehiscence; Surgical Wound Infection; Survival Rate"

This retrospective study sought to determine whether a correlation exists between perforation and obstruction, and between these conditions and different clinicopathological factors in colorectal adenocarcinoma. The medical records of 1950 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma treated in our hospital during a 7-year period were retrospectively analyzed. One hundred patients (5%) were excluded from this study because of a loss of follow-up. Data on clinicopathological factors including age, sex, tumor location, surgical mortality, pathological type, stage, and long-time cancer-free rate were simultaneously analyzed. Patients were grouped as follows: Group 1, complete colonic obstruction without perforation (n = 120). Group 2, complete obstruction with perforation at the site of the cancer (n = 35); Group 3, complete obstruction with perforation proximal to the cancer (n = 13); and Group 4, nonobstructing, nonperforated cancers (n = 1682). When compared with Group 4, Group 1 had a more advanced Dukes' stage, older age, greater incidence of colonic versus rectal cancers, and a poorer cancer-free survival (P &lt; or = .005). Groups 2 and 3 had a greater incidence of colonic versus rectal cancers (P &lt; or = .004), and Group 3 had a greater operative mortality (P &lt; .001).

Patients were immunized before and also received one to two immunizations after surgical resection of their colorectal cancer. The vaccine was well tolerated with no associated toxicity. Lymphocytic infiltration within the resected tumors was quantified by immunohistochemistry and image analysis. Enhanced infiltration of helper T cells (CD4) and natural killer (NK) cells (CD56) were observed in the tumors from immunized patients when compared with tumors from stage, grade, site, age, and sex matched unimmunized patients. NK activity was increased in the blood, peaking 7-10 days post immunization and then dropping rapidly and correlating with NK extravasation within the tumor. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of 105AD7 anti-idiotype and the antigen it mimics, CD55, has predicted that patients with HLA-DR1, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DR7 haplotypes should show helper T cell responses following 105AD7 vaccination. Eighty-three percent of patients expressing these haplotypes responded to 105AD7, whereas 88% of patients who failed to express these haplotypes were nonresponders. With a median follow-up of 4 years (range, 2.5-6 years) 65% of patients remained disease free. This trial shows that 105AD7 stimulates antitumor inflammatory responses allowing extravasation within tumor deposits of both helper T cells and NK cells. This represents a way of evaluating immune responses in patients both within the blood and at the tumor site. The study confirms that immunization with a human anti-idiotypic antibody results in immune responses in 83% of patients with a permissive haplotype.";"2000";"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research";"Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic; Antigens, CD; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD55 Antigens; Cancer Vaccines; Cecal Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; HLA-DR Antigens; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating; Male; Neoplasm Staging; Rectal Neoplasms; Sigmoid Neoplasms; Survival Analysis"

The authors investigated whether primary cytoreductive surgery including rectosigmoid colon resection would affect the recurrence free interval and survival of these patients. Between April 1990 and April 1997, 66 previously untreated Stage IIIC-IV ovarian carcinoma patients with macroscopic involvement of the rectosigmoid colon were enrolled. All patients underwent cytoreductive surgery with rectosigmoid colon resection to remove residual tumor less than 2 cm in greatest dimension and received 6 cycles of cisplatin-based postoperative chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 26 months (range, 7-104 months). In multivariate analysis, residual disease and depth of tumor infiltration of the bowel wall were independently associated with overall survival and recurrence free interval. Disease stage was independently associated only with overall survival. Residual tumor was the most strongly predictive factor for recurrence or death. The 2-year estimated survival rates according to the amount of residual tumor were 100% for 24 patients with no macroscopic residual disease and 77.3% for 28 patients with residual disease less than 1 cm. None of the 14 patients with residual disease larger than 1 cm were alive 2-years after operation. Overall, 48 patients (72.7%) developed disease recurrence: 43 (65.1%) in the abdomen, 19 (29.8%) in the liver, and 3 (4.5%) in the pelvis. The current findings suggest that cytoreductive surgery with rectosigmoid colon resection should be considered for ovarian carcinoma patients with bulky pelvic disease to help ensure that they are left with no residual disease after debulking surgery.";"2000";"Cancer";"Adult; Aged; Carcinoma; Colon, Sigmoid; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovarian Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome"

A technique is needed which improves long-term survival. Previous studies in the rat have shown that electrolysis is a safe, predictable and reproducible method for creating areas of necrosis in the normal rat liver. This study examined the effects of electrolysis on colorectal liver 'metastases' in the rat. Tumours of colorectal origin were implanted into the livers of Wistar-WAG rats. Two weeks after implantation the tumours were treated with electrolysis. A direct current generator, connected to 2 platinum intrahepatic electrodes was used to examine the effects of various electrode configurations on the extent of tumour necrosis. Significant (p&lt;0.001) tumour ablation was achieved with all electrode configurations. Tumour necrosis was more complete (p&lt;0.05) with the electrodes positioned on either side of the tumour than with both electrodes placed in the centre of the tumour. Liver enzymes (AST and ALT) were significantly (p&lt;0.001) elevated after treatment, but returned towards normal by 2 days. This study has shown that colorectal liver 'metastasis' can be ablated by electrolysis in a rat model. Two separate mechanisms of tumour ablation were observed: With the electrodes directly in or adjacent to the tumour, necrosis resulted from the action of cytotoxic electrode products, whereas by positioning the electrodes proximal to the tumour, necrosis was induced by a 'secondary' ischaemic effect. The findings confirm the view that electrolysis has great potential for treating patients with unresectable malignant liver tumours.";"2000";"Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)";"Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Colorectal Neoplasms; Electrolysis; Liver; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental; Male; Necrosis; Neoplasm Transplantation; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reproducibility of Results; Tumor Cells, Cultured"

A study was performed of patients with colorectal cancer treated by laparoscopy in five German centers between May 1991 and September 1997. Surgical and pathologic data were recorded in an anonymous registry database and analyzed by type of resection. Standard procedures were sigmoid or left colectomy, anterior resection, abdominoperineal resection, and right hemicolectomy.

We reviewed 45 patients who underwent LAC (LAC group) and 62 patients who underwent traditional open surgery (Open group) for colorectal carcinoma in our hospital, and compared the clinical data between the two groups in an effort to determine whether LAC is really minimally invasive and if it enhances the quality of life. So that the backgrounds of the patients in both groups were almost the same, we only compared data of patients with colorectal carcinoma of stages 0, I, and II. The duration of surgery in the Open group was significantly shorter for all procedures except sigmoid resection, but the blood loss was not significantly different between any of the procedures except for right colectomy. The time to the first passing of flatus and restarting oral intake, length of hospital stay, and duration of epidural analgesia were significantly shorter in the LAC group. The morbidity and mortality rates in the LAC group were almost the same as those in the Open group at 29.5% and 3.3% versus 22.6% and 1.6%, respectively. However, five major complications of LAC for advanced colorectal carcinomas might be prevented by performing an open procedure.

These processes regulate the growth of normal and neoplastic epithelia, and in tumors, may confer prognostic information. To test this hypothesis, we determined apoptotic and mitotic indices (AI, MI) by morphology in H&amp;E sections of 154 lymph node-negative, sporadic colon carcinomas. The relationship of these indices to genetic (p53 and Bcl-2) and biological features (DNA ploidy and cell kinetics) and patient survival rates was determined. Tumor features were compared in proximal and distal tumors, given postulated differences in their pathogenesis. Bcl-2 and p53 proteins were examined using immunohistochemistry and DNA ploidy and proliferative indices (PIs) by flow cytometry. Tumor features were dichotomized for analysis of relapse-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates using a Cox proportional hazards model. Median patient follow-up was 8.8 years. The median AI and MI were 1.2% (0-7.6) and 0.40% (0-1.8), respectively, and did not differ by tumor site. AI correlated with histological grade (P = 0.03); MI correlated with PI (P = 0.02) and inversely with Bcl-2 in distal tumors (P = 0.02). p53 and Bcl-2 expression were detected in 52 and 53% of tumors, respectively. Distal tumor site was associated with aneuploidy (P = 0.001), p53 (P = 0.001), and PI &gt; 15% (P = 0.002). In a univariate analysis, colon cancers with high MIs (&gt;0.5%) had a poor prognosis (P = 0.04). Bcl-2 overexpression (&gt;20% + tumor cells) was associated with more favorable OS (P = 0.04). The association of ploidy and PI with outcome was of borderline significance for all tumors; however, diploidy predicted better survival in proximal cancers. In distal cancers, low AIs (&lt; or = 0.25%) and high MIs (&gt;0.5%) were adverse prognostic markers. After adjustment for other variables, an increased MI predicted shorter OS with a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 2.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.23-5.91 (P = 0.01). Expression of Bcl-2 was associated with more favorable OS (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.0; P = 0.06). In proximal cancers, Bcl-2 expression was the most important predictor of OS (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.85; P = 0.03). In distal tumors, low AIs (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.27-9.09; P = 0.01) and high MIs predicted poor survival. In conclusion, increased mitosis and low or absent Bcl-2 expression are significant risk factors for death in node-negative colon cancers, as are low rates of apoptosis in distal tumors. If validated prospectively, our results may identify patient subsets than can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.";"1999";"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research";"Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Apoptosis; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Cycle; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Menstrual Cycle; Middle Aged; Mitotic Index; Ploidies; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Survival Rate; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"

From January 1988 to December 1997, 35 patients received preoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy) followed by rectal resection through a combined abdominal and transanal approach. Thirty patients had preoperative tumor staging with endorectal ultrasonography: uT1N0 = 2, uT2N0 = 6, uT2N+ = 2, uT3N0 = 6, and uT3N+ = 14. Colorectal resection was performed on average 32 days after the conclusion of radiotherapy, and the distal colon stump was pulled through the anal canal. On postoperative day 5, the colonic stump was resected and a direct coloanal anastomosis performed. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed complete tumor sterilization in two cases, pT1N0 = 3, pT2N0 = 14, pT2N+ = 1, pT3N0 = 6, and pT3N+ = 9. There was no postoperative mortality and there was no leakage. One patient had a pelvic abscess, and another one had left colon necrosis which required re-operation. Median follow-up was 43 months (range 6-113). Two patients had locoregional recurrence, seven had distant metastasis, and 3 had both. Actuarial survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years was 97%, 86%, and 72% respectively. The rate of local control at 5 years was 78%. Functional results were evaluated by a new scoring system. Function was considered good in 59 and 70% at 1 and 2 years respectively. This new procedure is a safe and effective sphincter-preserving operation that avoids a diverting stoma.

Anastomotic leakage after colorectal resection is more prevalent when the anastomosis is in the distal or infraperitoneal pelvis than in the abdomen. The benefit of pelvic drains versus their potential harm has been questioned. Drain-related complications include (1) those possibly benefiting from drainage (leakage, intra-abdominal infection, bleeding) and (2) those possibly caused by drainage (wound infection or hernia, intestinal obstruction, fistula). Between September 1990 and June 1995, 494 patients (249 men and 245 women), mean age 66 +/- 15 (range 15 to 101) years, with either carcinoma, benign tumor, colonic Crohn's disease, diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon, or another disorder located anywhere from the right colon to the midrectum undergoing resection followed by rectal or anal anastomosis were randomized to undergo either drainage (n = 248) with 2 multiperforated 14F suction drains or no drainage (n = 246). The primary end point was the number of patients with one or more postoperative drain-related complications. Secondary end points included severity of these complications as assessed by the rate of related repeat operations and associated deaths as well as extra-abdominally related morbidity and mortality. After withdrawal of 2 patients (1 in each group) both groups were comparable with regard to preoperative characteristics and intraoperative findings. The overall leakage rate was 6.3% with no significant difference between those with or without drainage. There were 18 deaths (3.6%), 8 (3.2%) in those with drainage and 10 (4%) in those without drainage. Five patients with anastomotic leakage died (1%), 3 of whom had drainage. There were 32 repeat operations (6.5%) for anastomotic leakage 11 in the group with drainage and 4 in the group with no drainage. The rate of these and the other intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal complications did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

The first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma. The second patient developed bilateral lung metastases. Only one patient died during the follow-up period because of myocardial infarction. Although the follow-up is short, it seems that the recurrence rate is low.

The type I isoform (11beta-HSD1) is a bidirectional enzyme but acts predominantly as a oxidoreductase to form the active glucocorticoids cortisol or corticosterone, while the type II enzyme (11beta-HSD2) acts unidirectionally producing inactive 11-keto metabolites. There are no known clinical conditions associated with 11beta-HSD1 deficiency, but gene deletion experiments in the mouse indicate that this enzyme is important both for the maintenance of normal serum glucocorticoid levels, and in the activation of key hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes. Other important sites of action include omental fat, the ovary, brain and vasculature. Congenital defects in the 11beta-HSD2 enzyme have been shown to account for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME), a low renin severe form of hypertension resulting from the overstimulation of the non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor by cortisol in the distal tubule of the kidney. Inactivation of the 11beta-HSD2 gene in mice results in a phenotype with similar features to AME. In addition, these mice show high neonatal mortality associated with marked colonic distention, and remarkable hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the distal tubule epithelia. 11Beta-HSD2 also plays an important role in decreasing the exposure of the fetus to the high levels of maternal glucocorticoids. Recent work suggests a role for 11beta-HSD2 in non-mineralocorticoid target tissues where it would modulate glucocorticoid access to the glucocorticoid receptor, in invasive breast cancer and as a mechanism providing ligand for the putative 11-dehydrocorticosterone receptor. While previous homologies between members of the SCAD superfamily have been of the order of 20-30% phylogenetic analysis of a new branch of retinol dehydrogenases indicates identities of &gt; 60% and overlapping substrate specificities. The availability of crystal structures of family members has allowed the mapping of conserved 11beta-HSD domains A-D to a cleft in the protein structure (cofactor binding domain), two parallel beta-sheets, and an alpha-helix (active site), respectively.";"1999";"The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology";"11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Animals; Arterioles; Brain; Corticosterone; Humans; Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Isoenzymes; Kidney; Neoplasms; Placenta; Protein Conformation; Receptors, Glucocorticoid"

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed at least at one site in 369 cases or 54% of the tumours. LOHs detected ranged from 30-64%, depending on tumour location. The major results regarding LOH at different tumour locations were as follows: stomach, 20/38 (53%); colon and rectum, 60/109 (55%); lung, 38/63 (60%); breast, 145/238 (61%); endometrium, 18/25 (72%); ovary, 17/31 (55%); testis, 11/30 (37%); kidney, 22/73 (30%); thyroid, 4/14 (29%); and sarcomas, 9/14 (64%).

However, despite adoption of colonoscopic surveillance programs by many clinicians, we have noted a pattern of continued referrals for inflammatory bowel disease-associated malignancy. This study was undertaken in an effort to characterize this cohort of patients. We reviewed the operative records of a large metropolitan colorectal practice from 1983 to 1995. During this period 40 large-bowel resections were performed for patients with documented inflammatory bowel disease and concomitant carcinoma. A retrospective analysis was conducted with emphasis on clinical presentation, pathologic description, and most recent follow-up. Mean age at the time of diagnosis of cancer was 48 years with an average inflammatory bowel disease duration of 19 years. Seven patients had documented inflammatory bowel disease for less than eight years before their cancer diagnosis. Carcinomas were identified preoperatively by colonoscopy in 92 percent of patients. One-half of these patients had the colonoscopy to investigate a recent change in inflammatory bowel disease symptoms or signs, whereas the other half underwent endoscopy as routine surveillance. For the remaining 8 percent of patients, operated on for worsening symptoms, the carcinoma was detected in the pathological specimen only. The majority of patients (68 percent) did not have a preoperative diagnosis of dysplasia. Twenty-five percent of tumors were mucinous, 20 percent were multicentric, and 70 percent were located distal to the splenic flexure. Among the seven patients who died, four had pancolitis, six had a recent worsening of symptoms, and all had cancer involving the rectum. Cancer occurs at a younger age in patients with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. The tumors are often mucinous, multiple, and located in the left colon. Despite increasing acceptance of surveillance colonoscopy as a recommended strategy in cancer prevention, almost one-half of the patients in this study had their cancer diagnosed because increased colitis symptoms led to colonoscopic examination. Eighteen percent of patients developed cancer with less than an eight-year history of inflammatory bowel disease. These data call into question the effectiveness of dysplasia surveillance as a population-based strategy to decrease the colorectal cancer mortality in inflammatory bowel disease patients.";"1999";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Adult; Aged; Colitis, Ulcerative; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Crohn Disease; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies"

This represents approximately 9.5 percent of the United States population. Adenosquamous carcinomas arising in the colon, rectum, and anus were identified using the International Classification of Diseases-O codes. The Astler-Coller tumor classification was used for staging. Two-tailed Student's t-test, Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared tests, and generalized Wilcoxon's tests were used for comparisons of means, proportions, and actuarial survival rates, respectively. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. One hundred forty-five cases of adenosquamous carcinoma were identified, representing 0.06 percent of all colorectal malignancies. The mean age of patients was 67 years. Eighty-four percent of patients were Caucasians, 15 percent were Afro-Americans, and 1 percent were other races. Afro-Americans were diagnosed at a significantly younger age (median age, 62 years; P = 0.03). Fifty-three percent of the carcinomas were located in the sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus, 28 percent in the right colon, and the rest in the middle segment. Seventy-four percent of distal cases were staged A through C, compared with 44 percent of proximal cases. Patients with adenosquamous carcinoma of the sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus survived longer than all other patients (P = 0.001).

Patients may present with carcinomatosis as the pattern of metastases at the initial diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Little is known about the natural history of carcinomatosis and the prognostic factors affecting outcome. All patients treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 1988 to 1994 who presented with carcinomatosis at the initial diagnosis of colorectal cancer were identified. A retrospective review of the medical records for patient and tumor demographics was performed. Estimated survival distributions were calculated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. Tests of significance with respect to survival distribution were based on the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used for the multivariate analysis. There were 31 males and 38 females. The median age was 61 years (range, 26-80). The primary cancers were in the sigmoid with 24 patients (35%), cecum with 14 patients (20%), and transverse colon with 11 patients (16%). The remainder were distributed throughout the colon and rectum. The most common presentation was large bowel obstruction in 29 patients (42%). T3 and T4 cancers were present in 39 (57%) and 13 patients (19%), respectively. Lymph nodes were positive in 39 patients (57%), and mucin-producing tumors were also present in 39 patients (57%). Twelve patients (17%) had one site of disease, 17 patients (25%) had two sites of disease, and 37 (54%) patients had three or more sites of disease. Ascites was present in 29 patients (42%). Residual disease was present at the completion of surgery in 45 patients, absent in 13 patients, and status unknown in 11. The presence of residual disease (p = 0.0001), presence of ascites (p = 0.02), stage greater than T3 (p = 0.02), and increasing number of carcinomatosis sites (p = 0.006) were found to have a negative impact on survival on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, only the presence of residual disease at the completion of surgery was found to be an independent predictor of survival (p = 0.04). Overall median survival was 14 months with a 26% estimated 2-year survival.

Purpose of the research was to provide an updated description of the main findings (in particular, incidence, staging, morphology and survival) observed in the 12-year registration period. Between January 1984 and December 1995, 1,899 malignancies of the large bowel in 1,831 patients were registered. Tumours were classified according to the International Classification of the Diseases for Oncology (ICDO) and staged with the TNM system. Cancer specific survival was assessed with life table analysis and Log-Rank tests. Crude incidence rate showed minor fluctuations between 1984 and 1989, but tended to rise in the following years. Tumours were mostly located distal to the splenic flexure (73.3% of the total), with a slight tendency over time to a gradual &quot;shift&quot; to the right colon. Staging became progressively more favourable throughout the registration; in 1984 both stages I, II and stage IV + unstaged lesions represented 40% of the total, but in 1995 the former rose to 50% whereas the latter fell to 21.6% (p &lt; 0.001). This move to earlier stages resulted in an improved survival of patients registered in 1990-91 versus 1984-85 (Log-Rank 14.3 p &lt; 0.002).

These genes have been demonstrated to be altered in the germline of patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). HNPCC is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a preponderance of proximal colon, young age of onset, increased multiplicity, and improved stage-specific survival. In this study, we examined the expression of hMSH2 protein in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). As a result, the frequency of right-sided CRC and multiple CRCs were significantly higher in the patients with hMSH2-negative CRC than in those with hMSH2-positive CRC. The rate of p53 positivity was significantly lower in the hMSH2-negative tumours than that in the hMSH2-positive tumours. The disease-free survival rate tended to be higher in the patients with hMSH2-negative CRC than in the patients with hMSH2-positive CRC. Our findings suggest that both the clinicopathological and biological features of hMSH2-negative sporadic CRC seemed to be similar to those of HNPCC.

In none of the cases was a preoperative diagnosis correctly made. It is concluded that a triad of symptoms and signs (renal pain, weight loss, and large tumor size) as well as a triad of imaging characteristics (areas of low density on the CT scan, hypoechoic areas on ultrasound, and hypovascularity on angiography) may hold the promise of a preoperative diagnosis.

The case reported illustrates the clinical presentation and preferred initial management of these fistulae. A 61-year-old white male underwent two wedge resections for colorectal metastases to the liver with removal of a portion of the right diaphragm. Four years later, he developed obstructive jaundice secondary to tumor recurrence in the porta hepatis, which required endoscopic stent placement, radiation, and chemotherapy. Almost 2 years later, he developed frank biliptysis. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) revealed occlusion of the common hepatic duct stent and a bronchobiliary fistula. With adequate reestablishment of common duct drainage, the patient rapidly improved and was discharged free of symptoms. Bronchobiliary fistulae are rare complications of hepatic resection that can present from days to years after operation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and PTC are the diagnostic studies of choice and offer the possibility of therapeutic intervention. Although large series in the literature emphasize the surgical management of bronchobiliary fistulae, the reoperative procedures tend to be complicated, with a significant morbidity and mortality.

During the last six years, 31 consecutive patients underwent this procedure: in 24 patients, electrostimulated double-wrap graciloplasty was performed simultaneously with abdominoperineal resection for lower rectal cancer, 7 strictly selected patients underwent conversion to an abdominal stoma following previous abdominoperineal resection (mean length of time from stoma creation, 71.4 months) Anorectal reconstruction was performed following a surgical scheme already standarized since 1985 in 102 patients: after abdominoperineal resection, the distal colon was pulled through to the perineum and surrounded by both gracilis muscles following an &quot;alfa and new-sling&quot; configuration; using platinumiridium electrodes, both muscles were then connected to pulse generator, which was implanted subcutaneously in the abdomen. All surgical steps were performed during the same surgical session to allow early postoperative stimulation of the transposed muscles. A contemporary covering stoma was abandoned as a standard procedure; the distal colon was left closed for a few postoperative days, then it was resected and sutured to the perineum under local anesthesia. Eighteen patients underwent preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy or both, without any significant adverse outcome. To increase gracilis resistance to prolonged &quot;tonic&quot; contraction, patients underwent a chronic, low-frequency stimulation protocol. In the last 11 patients, a new &quot;over-the-nerve and intramuscular&quot; implant was adopted to optimize fiber recruitment and to reduce electrostimulation thresholds. At regular intervals, all patients were evaluated using continence scores and questionnaires, electromanometry, endoluminal ultrasound study, and defecography. Twenty-six of 31 patients were evaluated for continence, with a mean length of follow-up of 37.8 (range, 4-68) months; 3 patients died because of cancer recurrence, 1 underwent conversion to an abdominal stoma, and 1 is waiting for stoma closure. Continence to liquid and solid stools was achieved in 22 patients (85 percent), and electromanometry findings confirmed a good muscular contraction postoperatively and during follow-up intervals. No postoperative mortality (40 days) was observed; the postoperative complication rate was high 22-percent), but early treatment (drainage and temporary diversion in 7 patients) led to favorable outcomes (4 resolutions, 3 partial muscular impairments). Four stimulators had to be temporarily explanted because of late complications, and two stimulators had to be replaced because of battery exhaustion after three years of use with high stimulation parameters. A significant difference was observed comparing full-contracting threshold after intramuscular (14 patients) and the new over-the-nerve and intramuscular implant technique. The study contained herein confirms the efficacy of the surgical scheme we have adopted since 1985 to reconstruct sphincteric apparatus after abdominoperineal resection of the rectum. The &quot;one-step&quot; timing of surgical and electrostimulation-related procedures and the early start of stimulation did not show a significant increase in the complication rate and did not produce noticeable muscular or nerve damage. Adoption of chronic electrostimulation protocols using implantable devices increased the rate of fully continent patients; nevertheless, the overall cost for devices and medical staff duties was high, and a small increase of late morbidity was observed. Finally, the preliminary experience with our new technique of electrode implants encourages further application.";"1998";"Diseases of the colon and rectum";"Adult; Aged; Anal Canal; Colon; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscles; Perineum; Postoperative Complications; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rectal Neoplasms; Reoperation; Treatment Outcome"

During an eight-year period, all patients with rectal cancer were prospectively audited. For tumors of the middle and lower thirds of the rectum, a total mesorectal excision was performed; for tumor of the upper third, mesorectal excision proceeded at least 5 cm distal to the primary tumor. Resected specimens were subjected to careful histologic assessment, and patients undergoing curative procedures were entered into a surveillance program to detect both local and distant recurrence. Of 218 patients in the cohort, 9 had no resection, 14 underwent local excision, 1 had pre-operative radiotherapy, and 42 patients (20 percent) had palliative resections and were excluded from further analysis. This left 152 patients having a curative resection, of whom 20 (13 percent) had tumor within 1 mm of the circumferential margin. After follow-up until death or a median period of 41 months, recurrent disease was seen in 24 percent of patients with a negative margin and 50 percent with a positive margin. Both disease-free survival and mortality were significantly related to margin involvement (log-rank, P = 0.01 and P = 0.005, respectively). Local recurrence, however, was not significantly different in the two groups (11 and 15 percent, respectively; log-rank, P = 0.38). When mesorectal excision is performed, circumferential margin involvement is more an indicator of advance disease than inadequate local surgery.

Early complications were limited to ureteral fistulas (n = 6, 16%) in patients who had already a preoperative fistula (n = 3) and in patients with peritoneal metastases on the superior wall of the bladder. The secondary destruction of the kidney (four secondary nephrectomies) occurred when the function of the kidney was already impaired at the time of the procedure. There were no secondary fistulas, no secondary obstruction of the prosthesis. The longest follow-up was 69 months. The silicone prostheses used for the replacement of ureters are reliable and still permeable beyond 5 years.

In the last 10 years, the most important advances in interventional ultrasound have occurred in therapeutic applications, fostering and facilitating the development of the so-called minimally-invasive techniques. Among all these new applications for the treatment of fluid collections, inflammatory diseases, benign and malignant tumors, the most recent dramatic advances have occurred in primary and secondary liver malignancies, which will be the focus of this review. The rationale for the local treatment of primary and secondary liver cancers differs according to the success of conventional treatments (e.g. surgery and chemotherapy) and to the survival rates of such conditions, depending on clinical stage, patient age, associated diseases, and so on. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous therapies for liver cancer can be divided into: (1) direct intratumoral injection of chemical agents, such as ethanol, hot saline and acetic acid; and (2) thermally-mediated techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation, interstitial laser photocoagulation, microwave therapy or cryotherapy. Through different mechanisms of action, all these methods induce cell death by coagulative necrosis. The clinical efficacy of some of these techniques has been clearly established, like percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, experience with the other techniques is much more preliminary, mostly due to the limited availability of sufficient clinical trials and to the fascinating speed of technological development. We review the state-of-the-art of the two most promising techniques, namely radiofrequency ablation and interstitial laser photocoagulation, and the present preliminary clinical data in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas and liver metastases. Radiofrequency energy is delivered to the tumors by means of electrode-needles (14-17 G) electrically insulated along all but the distal portion of the shaft and percutaneously introduced into the targets under ultrasound guidance. In the short history of this method, several technologies have been tested and used, but 'multiple-hook' and 'internal-cooling' electrodes are currently the leading choices, providing large necrosis volumes (up to 5 cm in diameter for a single 12-min application with an array of three internal-cooling electrodes) in short sessions, under local or general anesthesia. Radiofrequency ablation has proved its usefulness in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas, achieving complete necrosis in over 85-90% of cases in lesions smaller than 5 cm in diameter and in single sessions, with a low rate (&lt; 10%) of local recurrences. In the treatment of liver metastases, whose very poor responsiveness to percutaneous ethanol injection and other 'chemical' therapies is extensively reported in the literature, radiofrequency ablation has 65-75% reported complete efficacy in the control of local tumor growth in lesions not exceeding 4 cm. Such great efficacy has been so far coupled with very low rates of major side-effects (&lt; 2%), most of them requiring no surgical repair. Interstitial laser photocoagulation induces thermally-mediated coagulation through thin optic (Nd:YAG) fibers percutaneously inserted into the target under ultrasound guidance. Multiple fibers (beam splitters) are usually required to achieve a sufficiently wide necrosis volume. The reported success rate (complete necrosis and local control of tumor growth) ranges 45-75%) of the lesions, mostly liver metastates from colorectal carcinoma. An equally low rate of complications is reported for interstitial laser photocoagulation as for radiofrequency ablation, that is no more than 2-3% of cases.

(Corresponding figures from the NSW Central Cancer Registry were: A and B, 48%; C, 26%; D, 14% and unknown 12%) [corrected]. Colorectal polyps were found in a further 819 people (21.3%), and were adenomatous in 577 (79% of the 733 in whom histological diagnosis was available). Other gastrointestinal conditions were found in 1343 people (34.9%), while no cause was found for the positive result, despite adequate investigation, in 873 (22.7%). Community-based screening with faecal occult blood testing detected colorectal carcinomas at earlier histological stages than colorectal carcinomas reported to the Cancer Registry and should reduce mortality from this disease. Treatment and follow-up of adenomatous polyps detected by such a program might minimise the incidence of colorectal carcinoma in this group.";"1998";"The Medical journal of Australia";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colorectal Neoplasms; Humans; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; New South Wales; Occult Blood"

Mean ages of colorectal cancer onset were 44, 46, and 69 years for MLH1, MSH2, and the general population, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). More proximal and fewer distal colon cancers were noted in HNPCC than the general population (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.04). Site distribution showed disparity of rectal cancers (8 percent MLH1 vs. 28 percent MSH2; P = 0.01) based on genotypes.

RII is mutated in the majority of colon tumours exhibiting widespread microsatellite instability, a characteristic generally referred to as the replication error phenotype (RER+). We investigated the association between RII mutations and various clinicopathological variables and genetic alterations in a large series of sporadic adenocarcinomas arising in the proximal colon. RII mutations were found in 17 per cent (36/210) of right-sided tumours and in 86 per cent (32/37) of those displaying RER+.

In addition, the time periods 1971-1984 and 1985-1995 were compared; criteria for first liver resection did not change with time, whereas the attitude toward re-resection was more aggressive during the latter period. Operative mortality was 6% during 1971-1984 and 0% during 1985-1995 (3.6% for all patients). The crude 5-year actuarial survivals were 19% and 35% for patients operated during 1971-1984 and 1985-1995, respectively (25% for the whole period). Relapse at any site was observed in 52 patients (81%) operated during the first period and in 29 patients (67%) operated during the second period; re-resection was performed in 12 (23%) and 15 (52%) of these patients, respectively. Five-year survival after hepatic re-resection was 29% (no operative mortality). In the univariate analysis, significant determinants for long-term survival were, in descending order, a clear resection margin, high degree of fibrosis around the tumor, absence of extrahepatic metastases (including metastases to the liver hilum), use of an ultrasound dissector, low preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, year of resection (1985-1995), and low/moderate grade of liver tumor. There were no 5-year survivors when extrahepatic metastases were present, the liver tumor(s) had a low differentiation or satellites, or the resection margin was involved with tumor. In the multivariate analysis, the determinants were grade of liver tumor, absence of extrahepatic tumor, few intraoperative blood transfusions, low preoperative serum CEA level, and year of resection (1985-1995). It is concluded that: (1) an increased rate of hepatic re-resection was partly responsible for the improved outcome after liver resection for colorectal metastases during recent years; (2) patients with extrahepatic metastases did not benefit from liver resection; and (3) surgery should be performed with a clear resection margin and minimal blood loss.";"1998";"World journal of surgery";"Adult; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Hepatectomy; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate"

French Associations for Surgical Research.";"To investigate the role of omentoplasty (OP) in the prevention of anastomotic leakage after colonic or rectal resection. It has been proposed that OP--wrapping the omentum around the colonic or rectal anastomosis--reinforces intestinal sutures with the expectation of lowering the rate of anastomotic leakage. However, there are no prospective, randomized trials to date to prove this. Between September 1989 and March 1994, a total of 705 patients (347 males and 358 females) with a mean age of 66 +/- 15 years (range, 15-101) originating from 20 centers were randomized to undergo either OP (n = 341) or not (NO, n = 364) to reinforce the colonic anastomosis after colectomy. Patients had carcinoma, benign tumor, colonic Crohn's disease, diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon, or another affliction located anywhere from the right colon to and including the midrectum. Patients undergoing emergency surgery were not included. Random allotment took place once the resection and anastomosis had been performed, the surgeon had tested the anastomosis for airtightness, and the omental flap was deemed feasible. Patients were divided into four strata: ileo- or colocolonic anastomosis, supraperitoneal ileo- or colorectal anastomosis, infraperitoneal ileo- or colorectal anastomosis, and ileo- or coloanal anastomosis. The primary end point was anastomotic leakage. Secondary end points included intra- and extraabdominal related morbidity and mortality. Severity of anastomotic leakage was based on the rate of repeat operations and related deaths. Both groups were comparable in terms of preoperative characteristics. Intraoperative findings were similar, except that there were significantly more septic operations and abdominal drainage performed in the NO group (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Thirty-five patients (4.9%) had postoperative anastomotic leakage, 16 in the OP group (4.7%) and 19 in the NO group (5.2%). There were 32 deaths (4.5%), 17 (4.9%) in the OP group and 15 (4.2%) in the NO group. Five patients with anastomotic leakage died (0.8%), 2 of whom had OP. There were 37 repeat operations (30%), 12 (6 in each group) for anastomotic leakage. Repeat operation was associated with fatal outcome in 14% of cases. The rate of these and the other intra- and extraabdominal complications did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Most previous studies were conducted retrospectively using archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor samples. Conversely, few data on prospective studies employing fresh or frozen tissue specimens are available. There is general agreement that fresh/frozen material is more reliable than paraffin embedded tissue for DNA ploidy analysis by flow cytometry. In the current investigation we evaluated the prognostic significance of nuclear DNA content in a prospective series of 191 patients with curatively resected TNM Stage II (n = 107) or Stage III (n = 84) sporadic colon carcinomas. DNA ploidy status was assessed by flow cytometry utilizing multiple frozen tumor samples. Mean follow-up in surviving patients was 48.5 months (median, 46.9 months; range, 29-77 months). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust for several clinical and pathologic covariates. Of the 191 carcinomas examined, 47 (24.6%) were classified as DNA diploid and 144 (75.4%) as DNA aneuploid. DNA ploidy pattern was significantly related to tumor site (P &lt; 0.0001), histologic type (P = 0.0002), and grade of differentiation (P = 0.009), but not to other clinical and pathologic variables. Patients with DNA diploid tumors showed a better disease free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.021) than patients with DNA aneuploid adenocarcinomas. In particular, patients with Stage II DNA diploid tumors (n = 30) had an excellent clinical outcome, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 97%. When patients were analyzed according to the anatomic site of the tumor, a significant relationship between DNA ploidy status and disease free and overall survival was observed in the group of patients with carcinomas of the proximal colon (n = 84) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.002, respectively), but not among patients whose tumors were sited distally to the splenic flexure (n = 107). In multivariate analysis, nuclear DNA content was demonstrated to be an independent prognostic variable for both disease free and overall survival. Furthermore, in the group of patients with tumors of the proximal colon, DNA ploidy pattern was the single most important prognostic factor. Our results confirm that flow cytometric DNA ploidy status is a significant and independent prognostic factor in patients with colon carcinoma.

From January 1986 to September 1996, 91 patients received one-stage resection with primary anastomosis for acute obstruction of the left colon. Eighty-five of these 91 patients were operated on for carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Subtotal colectomies were performed in 20 patients, left hemicolectomies in 21 patients, sigmoid colectomies in 34 patients, and anterior resections in 16 patients. The preoperative serum albumin level was less than 3 gm/dl in 17 patients (less than 2.5 gm/dl in 10 patients). Four patients had associated abscesses, and one patient had colonic perforation with peritonitis before operative colonoscopy. Neither antegrade nor retrograde irrigation was performed. Operative mortality rate was 2.2 percent. There were two cases (2.2 percent) of anastomotic leakages. Other common complications included wound infection (11 cases), urinary tract infection (5 cases), intestinal obstruction (6 cases), and respiratory failure (3 cases). This experience suggests that an anastomosis can be performed more safely in patients with acute obstruction of the left colon than in those with an anastomosis in the nondiverted colon.

Eighty-one patients with 24 months' follow-up were assessable. Low anterior resection (LAR) was performed in 64 (79%) patients and abdominoperineal resection (APR) in 17 (21%). Twentynine (36%) stage II and 52 (64%) stage III patients entered the study. Within 45-60 days from surgery all patients received 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy at the dose of 500 mg/m2/iv/d 1-5, every 4 weeks, for six cycles. Chemotherapy cycles 3 and 4 were administered at the same daily dose on radiotherapy days 1-3 and 29-31. Radiotherapy total dose consisted of 45 Gy/1.8 Gy/day administered in 5 weeks with 18 MV photon beam to the pelvis with the four field &quot;box&quot; technique. Perineal scar was encompassed only after APR. A boost dose of 5.4 Gy to the tumor bed was given in 3 fractions of 1.8 Gy. Median follow-up was 37 months (range: 24-74 months). Overall recurrent disease was reported in 28 of 81 patients (34%): local, systemic and both local and systemic relapses in 9 (11%), 14 (17%) and 5 (6%) cases, respectively. According to local extension, recurrence rates were 10% and 48% in stages II and III, respectively. Five-year overall and disease-free actuarial survivals were 64% and 61%, respectively. Median time to relapse was 15 months (range: 7-43 months). Significant prognostic factors for better tumor control were: stage (II vs III), disease site (proximal vs distal rectum), the surgical procedure (LAR vs APR), the number of involved nodes (&lt; or = 4 vs &gt; 4) and no extracapsular node invasion. The recommended dose of combined radiochemotherapy regimen used in this trial was generally well tolerated. The incidence of any grade &gt; or = 3 acute toxicity (according to WHO grading) was 20% diarrhea, 6% tenesmus and 4% myelosuppression. Five (6%) patients had cronic diarrhea and other 3 (4%) radiotherapy-related severe late toxicity which required surgery. This study seems to provide similar survival and recurrence notes to other radio-chemotherapy regimens published in the literature. However, a more aggressive approach is warranted in stage III patients considering the low 5-year survival recorded.";"1998";"La Radiologia medica";"Adult; Aged; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prospective Studies; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Rectal Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Survival Rate"

Reliable data from prospective multicenter studies involving consecutive patients are also lacking. On the basis of the personal caseloads of specialized surgeons or of retrospective analyses, it is difficult to judge the true effectiveness of this new technique. This study aims to investigate the results of laparoscopic colorectal surgery in consecutive patients operated on by unselected surgeons. This observational study was begun August 1, 1995, in the German-speaking part of Europe (Germany and Austria) and 43 centers initially agreed to participate. All consecutive cases were documented. All data were rendered anonymous. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The study committee was blinded to the participating center. By the end of the 1st year, 500 patients (M:F ratio 0.83, mean age 62.9 years) had been treated by 18 centers; 269 operations were performed for benign indications and 231 for cancer (palliative and curative). Most operations were done on the distal colon or rectum. An anastomosis was performed in 84%, with an overall leakage rate of 5.3% (colon 3.6% and rectum 11.8%), which required surgical reintervention in 1.7%. The mean operating time was 176 min and showed a decreasing tendency over the period under study. The conversion rate was 7.0% and the overall complication rate 21.4%. The reoperation rate was 6.6%; the most common cause was bleeding. There was one ureteral lesion (0.2%), but urinary tract infections were fairly common (4.8%). A postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 1.6% of the cases. No thromboembolic complications were reported. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.4% and overall hospital mortality 1.8%. Laparoscopic colorectal operations are still rare (about 1% of all colorectal operations in Germany). Laparoscopic procedures are more common on the left colon and rectum than on the right colon. The surgical complication rate is acceptable, comparable with rates reported by others for open surgery. Cardiopulmonary and thromboembolic complications were rarely seen. Mortality and surgical morbidity rates do not differ significantly among participating centers. A learning curve, reflected by a shortening of the operating time and a somewhat lower conversion rate, was observed over the observation period.";"1998";"Surgical endoscopy";"Aged; Colonic Diseases; Colorectal Surgery; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Random Allocation; Rectal Diseases; Treatment Outcome"

Recent interest has surrounded the application of expandable metal stenting in acute obstruction but has been confined to the left colon. We describe successful application of stenting in the right colon, allowing postponement of a particularly high-risk laparotomy. A patient with acute bilateral iliofemoral thromboses simultaneously developed complete obstruction of the proximal transverse colon. After heparinization and under fluoroscopic control, a 10-cm-long, self-expanding Wall-stent (Schneider, Bulach, Switzerland), 22 mm in diameter, was manipulated across the obstruction. Immediate decompression with symptomatic relief ensued. The stent prevented obstruction during a 10-week period of anticoagulation, and repeat duplex scanning showed resolution of iliac thrombus. An elective right hemicolectomy was then performed. Postoperative course was uncomplicated, and histopathology confirmed a Dukes B carcinoma. This case, in which a potentially hazardous laparotomy was delayed until the operative risk improved, defines a new role for stenting in colonic obstruction and demonstrates an extension of its applicability to the right colon.

In reviewing 470 cases from the literature the most commonly associated disorders are found; 33 patients (7%) were diagnosed as idiopathic. Only 273 cases were available for detailed analysis of age, sex, mode of treatment, presence of perforation, mortality rate. The mortality rate was 17.6%. When comparing the different treatment procedures, surgery has a higher mortality rate (23.5%) than medical treatment or colonoscopy (12.1%) (p &lt; 0.02). In this study the presence of perforation increased mortality from 15.1% to 29.9% (p &lt; 0.03). The mortality rate for cecostomy is 15.3% vs 30.1% for other surgical procedures. Recently the syndrome pathogenesis is attributed to an autonomic imbalance, between the sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the colon: sympathetic prevalence due to sacral parasympathetic derangement, lead to inhibition of colonic peristalsis. The attention must be focused on early diagnosis and prompt treatment; for this purpose colonoscopy seams to be a safe method of establishing the diagnosis and carrying out treatment.";"1998";"Minerva chirurgica";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction; Fatal Outcome; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged"

After caecostomy, no further resection was performed in two patients. In 25 patients, the obstructing tumour was resected after a median period of 14 days. In 17 (68%) patients the caecostomy was closed simultaneously. In 8 patients this was done at a third stage. Histologic examination revealed diverticular disease in 6 and adenocarcinoma in 19 patients. No deaths occurred after caecostomy nor was there major morbidity. After colonic resection, one in-hospital, nonprocedure related, death occurred (mortality rate 4%). In 21 patients with an anastomosis no dehiscence occurred. Other postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients (morbidity rate 20%). The median hospital stay for patients with a two-stage procedure was 32 days and with a three-stage procedure 39.5 days. The staged procedure in the management of acute colonic obstruction is still a safe and acceptable procedure in elderly patients with acute large bowel obstruction.

Patients with FAP will have colorectal adenomas develop and die of colorectal cancer if left untreated. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis removes all disease-bearing mucosa while preserving transanal passage of stools. Between 1981 and 1994, 187 patients with FAP, 11 to 59 years of age with a mean follow-up of 60 months (range, 5-170 months) had proctocolectomy and IPAA at Mayo Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota. All patients had a proximal anal canal mucosal excision and a hand-sewn anastomosis of the pouch to the anal canal at the dentate line. A temporary ileostomy was used in 85% of the patients. No early postoperative deaths occurred, although two patients died later of metastatic colorectal carcinoma present at their initial operation. More important, no patient had a new cancer develop after IPAA. The overall morbidity after operation was 24%, with small bowel obstruction being the most common complication (13%). Patients had four bowel movements/24 hours and good fecal control, which continued during follow-up. The IPAA eradicates the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with FAP.

The high rate of clinical mortality in this group of patients has made it necessary to devise a specific therapeutic approach. To define the therapeutic approach used for colon cancer in the elderly. A retrospective study. A secondary referral center. Ninety-nine patients with colon carcinoma that first became clinically manifested in an emergency situation were examined retrospectively. The patients had been treated from 1986 through 1995. All patients were older than 70 years. A total of 74 patients showed clinical manifestation of a colon carcinoma with an ileus, while 10 patients had tumor perforation. A further 15 patients had a perforation proximal to an obstructing tumor. Clinical lethality, surgical procedure, risk of comorbidity, and multiple organ system failure. Any increase in comorbidity was associated with a higher clinical lethality, which was especially true for the lungs, heart, and kidney, and also for diabetes. In 44.4% of the patients with a significantly higher comorbidity (P = .04) and a more advanced tumor stage (P &lt; .001), the tumor was left in situ during the primary surgical intervention. Patients who survived after staged resection had an even higher comorbidity at first presentation when compared with patients who survived after primary resection (P = .02). However, the comorbidity of deceased patients who were supposed to undergo staged resection did not differ significantly from the comorbidity of those who underwent primary resection (P = .70). The clinical lethality in patients who were managed by stoma only or by bypass anastomosis was markedly higher than that in patients who underwent primary resection (59.0% vs 43.6%). The significantly highest postoperative mortality rate was recorded in patients who underwent primary resection after colonic perforation (74%) (P = .03), while the significantly lowest postoperative mortality rate was recorded in patients who underwent primary resection after tumor obstruction (28%) (P &lt; .001). Postoperative failure of the lungs and heart and kidney failure requiring hemodialysis were associated with significantly higher clinical mortality rates (P &lt; .001 to P = .004). Postoperative complications occurred in 28 (28.3%) of the patients. However, rupture of the anastomosis was observed in only 2 of these patients. Generalized disease was associated with a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications (P = .04), which was especially true for pneumonia (P = .003). However, no effect on survival was found for patients with Dukes disease stage D. The lower mortality rate following primary resection is achieved by preselection of patients. The preselection is such that patients in poor general condition who have tumors in advanced stages are not treated by resection. The significantly (P = .03) highest postoperative mortality rate in patients who underwent primary resection after tumor perforation reflects the necessity of resection in those cases regardless of higher comorbidity. In an emergency situation, initial minimal surgery followed by staged resection is a feasible alternative to treat aged patients with a higher comorbidity and an intraoperatively established greater spread of tumor. This procedure permits delayed radical resection at the lowest rate of clinical mortality for this age group and is especially suitable for frail, aged patients in poor condition. The advantages of staged resection can be demonstrated by the fact that more patients with a higher comorbidity survive. The poor physiological adaptability of elderly patients limits their ability to compensate for postoperative organ failure and adds the risk of comorbidity. Hence, these 2 factors are associated with poor prognosis in this age group.";"1997";"Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)";"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Austria; Chi-Square Distribution; Colonic Neoplasms; Comorbidity; Emergencies; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Statistics, Nonparametric; Treatment Outcome"

This study was undertaken to see whether this finding applied to all colorectal surgery in the elderly and if so to try to identify the determining factors. All patients undergoing colorectal surgery between 1975 and 1990 were entered into a computerized database. Patients were divided into two groups, those less than 80 years (&lt; 80) and those 80 years and more (80+), and compared with regard to the type of surgery performed, the patient's race, the seniority of the surgeon, the patient's disease, the operation performed and the postoperative morbidity and mortality. In addition, patients undergoing major resectional surgery and patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery were compared separately. Of 2011 admissions, 88 were for patients of 80+. The male to female admission rate was 1:0.79 in the &lt; 80 group and 1:1.25 in the 80+ group. More surgical procedures were performed by consultants in older patients. More emergency admissions were for 80+ patients. Rectal, sigmoid and right colonic pathology was more common in the elderly. Very few elderly patients were admitted with minor anorectal problems. Rectal prolapse and colorectal cancer were the commonest causes for admission in octogenarians. There were more pulmonary and cardiovascular postoperative complications in 80+ patients. Urinary tract infections were also more common. The postoperative mortality rate was higher in older patients (7.9 vs 1.4%). Four hundred and sixty-two patients underwent major resectional surgery and 45 were 80+. Surgery for diverticular disease was more frequent in younger patients (13.4 vs 2.2%) and cancer surgery in older patients (93.3 vs 70.5%).

The postoperative death rate was higher in the elderly (11.9 vs 3.4%).

The conclusion after this study was that the most important worsening prognostic factors were the advanced stage evolution of the tumor and the occlusion. The females had a better prognosis than the males. The rural patients had a better prognosis than the urban. In our study the younger age isn't a worsening factor for survival. The patients with a longer history of the symptoms had an unexpected better survival rate than the others. Localization of the tumors at the site of the descending colon and flexures is an important negative prognostic factor. The penetrating feature of the tumor is more important than the lymphatic invasion for prognosis. Subtotal colectomy performed for stenotic tumors of the left colon, even in emergency for occlusions gave us one of the best 5-year survival rate (75%). The histopathologic type of undifferentiated carcinoma and the mucinous adenocarcinoma are associated with the poorest survival rate. The lymphoma has a better survival rate than the carcinoma.

Life expectancy, the risk of cancer and working capacity are very much better than previously recognised and are normal for many patients. Three population-based studies in ulcerative colitis have shown a mortality similar to or slightly less than the general population except in the first year after diagnosis, whilst two have shown a slightly higher mortality (standardized mortality ratio, SMR = 1.4), except for those with proctitis. In Crohn's disease, two population-based studies have also shown an increased mortality (SMR = 1.4), which is similar to that of unskilled manual labourers (SMR = 1.43) from all causes of death. Three other studies have shown no increase in overall mortality, except in the first 5 years after diagnosis, in those with proximal small intestinal disease and in some patients needing multiple operations. Insurance risks should be evaluated on an individual basis, after details of the extent and pattern of disease have been obtained. Although the 'standard life' in insurance terms differs from that of the general population, because people who seek life assurance are self-selected from a more affluent section of society, many patients can be identified who have a particularly good prognosis. These include patients with ulcerative proctitis, those with left-sided colitis in extended remission (&gt; 12 months), and patients more than 30 years old with localized ileal or ileocaecal Crohn's disease that has responded to treatment. From the published data, it is difficult to justify increasing the insurance premium in such patients.";"1997";"Alimentary pharmacology &amp; therapeutics";"Activities of Daily Living; Colitis, Ulcerative; Colorectal Neoplasms; Crohn Disease; Humans; Insurance Carriers; Insurance, Life; Life Expectancy; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Risk; United Kingdom"

The study comprises 372 patients treated for rectal cancer in five community hospitals in the south-east of the Netherlands. The follow-up period was 7-12 years. We studied the medical records of these patients in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry, and by checking the endoscopical, surgical and pathological reports, we traced the following events: local recurrence, distant metastasis and (cause of) death. Curative resection was carried out in 232 of the 372 cases (62%); post-operative radiotherapy was administered to 27% of stage B2 and 50% of stage C (Astler-Coller) patients. Crude and net 5-year survival rates were 45% and 58%, respectively. Local recurrence rates were 18%, without much variation per hospital. After adjustment for age, gender, tumour site and type of surgery, local recurrence was primarily determined by tumour penetration of the muscularis propria and lymph node infiltration, the relative risks being 2.5 and 3.1, respectively (90% confidence intervals: 1.1-5.9 and 1.5-6.4). Although patients with cancer of the distal segment (0-6 cm) had shorter survival times than with proximal tumours, tumour site only weakly influenced local recurrence rates.

Tumor characteristics were as follows: TNM state: I, 40 percent; II, 25 percent; III, 18 percent; IV, 17 percent; Differentiation: well-moderate, 88 percent; poor, 12 percent; carcinomatosis, 5 percent. Local (3.6 percent) and distant implantation occurred in four patients (1.1 percent). Only one of these patients died a cancer-related death (Stage III at 36 months). Cancer-related death rates increased with increasing stage of tumor: I, -4 percent; II, 17 percent; III, 31 percent; IV, 70 percent.

All morbidity, mortality, and pathology data were collected prospectively in a form suitable for computer storage and analysis as part of the ongoing Concord Hospital Colorectal Cancer Registry. Data concerning in hospital course were obtained by casenote review. Twenty-eight patients underwent LARHC, and 33 had an ORHC during the study period. The two groups were well matched with respect to age, sex, weight, associated comorbidities, and tumor stage. Mean operating room use time was significantly higher for LARHC (LARHC = 261 minutes; ORHC = 203 minutes; P &lt; 0.001). Mean hospital stay from date of resection was the same in both groups (LARHC = 12 days; ORHC = 12.2 days).

There was a significant shorter distal margin of resection in the LARHC group (ORHC = 13.4 cm; LARHC = 10 cm; P = 0.03). Total cost was significantly greater for LARHC ($9,064 vs. $7,881 (Australian); P &lt; 0.001). Median follow-up was 23.4 months for the LARHC group and 23.9 months for the ORHC group.

The degree of increase in the incidence of sigmoid colon carcinoma was almost the same as that of right-sided colon carcinoma. By birth cohort analysis, among those born in 1934 or earlier, the incidence at the same age was higher in the younger population.

No randomized trials have been performed to date to prove this specifically in esophagogastric anastomosis. One hundred fifty-four patients, 139 men and 15 women ranging in age from 36 to 83 years (mean, 50 +/- 10 years) and undergoing elective resection of esophageal or cardial carcinoma, were included in this multiinstitutional (14 centers) randomized study comparing the rate of anastomotic leakage after esophagogastric anastomosis performed manually or mechanically. Eligible for this study were patients with esophageal or cardial carcinoma located between the esophagogastric junction (included) and the upper border of the aortic arch. The choice between resection with or without thoracotomy was left to the discretion of the operating surgeon. Proximal resection of the fundus was mandatory. Intestinal tract continuity was reestablished in a one-stage procedure by an esophagogastric anastomosis without interposition of either the jejunum or the colon. The site of the anastomosis could be either intrathoracic or cervical. The principal end point was anastomotic leakage as judged by (1) egress of intestinal fluids or orally ingested methylene blue through drains, (2) sodium diatrozate swallow prescribed either routinely for all patients between postoperative days 3 and 8 or because of signs of leakage, or (3) reoperation or autopsy. After two patients were withdrawn for protocol violation, 152 patients, 74 in the manual group and 78 in the mechanical group, were studied. The number of anastomotic leakages was identical in both groups (n = 12, 16% and 15%, respectively). Overall 30-day mortality was 11%. Fewer deaths occurred in the manual group (7%), which had three anastomotic leakages, than in the mechanical group (15%), which had five anastomotic leakages, and fewer repeat operations were done in the manual group (n = 9) than in the mechanical group (n = 13), but both of these differences were not statistically significant. The duration of anastomosis and of operation was similar in both groups. In the mechanical group 16 anastomoses (20%) gave rise to technical mishaps (either in the fashioning of the purse-string, dilation of the esophagus, or in stapling). Among the factors recognized as potentially preventing leakage, only testing for airtightness was significantly correlated with less postoperative leakage (p &lt; 0.05). Eight postoperative strictures were recorded at 3 months in 62 (13%) patients in the manual group, whereas seven strictures occurred in 53 (13%) patients in the mechanical group. When mechanical staples rather than manual sutures are chosen, the disadvantages (technical mishaps and higher costs) are not counterbalanced by a gain of time or a decrease in the rate or severity of anastomotic leakage.";"1996";"Surgery";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagus; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reoperation; Risk Factors; Stomach; Stomach Neoplasms; Surgical Stapling"

Interesting trends are as follows: (1) the elderly ( &gt; 80 years) present with earlier stage disease than younger patients; (2) the National Cancer Institute recognized cancer centers have more patients with advanced disease than other types of hospitals; (3) all ethnic groups have generally similar stages of disease at presentation, except for African-Americans who have a slightly higher incidence of Stage IV disease; (4) the proximal migration of the primary cancer continues with 54.7% of primary colon cancer arising in the right colon in 1993 compared with 50.9% in 1988; (5) an interaction between grade and stage of cancer seems present; and (6) patients with Stage III colon cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a 5% improvement in 5-year relative survival. The NCDB data are useful for reporting what cancer treatments are being administered and what outcomes are occurring in the U.S. The data suggest an important biologic role for grade of cancer. They also suggest that African-Americans and other ethnic groups have the same outcome as non-Hispanic whites but that access to medical care may still be less.

The mesorectum has been regarded as an important site in local failure after surgery of rectal cancer. Total mesorectal excision (TME) has been raised by some colorectal surgeons to prevent early local recurrence. This study was performed to ascertain the incidence of metastatic lymph nodes in the distal mesorectum (DMR) of the colorectal cancer patient. We also examined the clinicopathologic risk factors of distal mesorectal metastasis. Eight of 53 patients had positive metastatic lymph nodes in DMR. Twenty-seven patients were Dukes B and 26 patients were Dukes C stage. Out of 26 Dukes C patients, 8 patients (30.8%) had metastatic lymph nodes in the DMR. However, there was no significant difference in risk factors between DMR positive and DMR negative patients with Dukes C stage. In conclusion, the incidence of metastatic lymph nodes in DMR was about 30.8%, therefore the mesorectum especially the DMR should be removed completely by total mesorectal excision to eradicate the metastatic lymph nodes which may cause local recurrence.";"1997";"Yonsei medical journal";"Aged; Female; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Postoperative Period; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum"

Duplicate samples of carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue was obtained by microdissection from 6 to 7-microns paraffin sections of 94 primary carcinomas (treatment years 1979-1993) and available lymph node and liver secondaries. In 55 patients informative (heterozygous) at this locus, allelic imbalance was examined in primary and secondary carcinomas. Microsatellite instability prevented assessment of allelic balance in two cases, and there was no evidence of homozygous loss at NME1 in any case analyzed. Allelic imbalance at the NME locus in carcinomas was frequent (27/53; 51%), and concordant results were obtained between primary carcinoma and secondary deposits in 30 of 33 (91%) cases. Three discordant cases showed allelic imbalance in secondary deposits but not the primary lesion. Although frequent, allelic imbalance at NME1 had no relationship to Dukes' stage at presentation or with subsequent hepatic metastasis, nor with the primary carcinoma site (proximal versus distal), tumor size, or mitotic or apoptotic index. Moreover, neither disease-free nor overall survival differed between patients with carcinomas showing NME1 allelic imbalance and patients with carcinomas that did not. Our results show that although allelic imbalance is frequent at the NME locus in primary and secondary colorectal carcinomas, there is no evidence to link this with clinical or pathological features or with metastatic potential. Microsatellite PCR and microdissection of enriched populations of carcinoma cells allowed uniformly successful analysis of samples from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue up to 15 years old and clear assessment of allelic imbalance in tumor specimens. Target sequences (e.g., microsatellites and minisatellites) up to approximately 200-250 bp may be reliably analyzed for allelic balance, suggesting that this method is of general utility in the genetic analysis of primary and metastatic neoplasia.";"1996";"Cancer research";"Adenocarcinoma; Alleles; Apoptosis; Base Sequence; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17; Colon; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Primers; Disease-Free Survival; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mitosis; Molecular Sequence Data; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases; Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Transcription Factors"

Genotype-phenotype correlation studies in patients with FAP have demonstrated associations of certain variants of the disease with mutations at specific sites within the APC gene. In a large FAP family, we identified a frameshift mutation located in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9. Phenotypic studies of affected family members showed that the clinical course of FAP was delayed, with gastrointestinal symptoms and death from colorectal carcinoma occurring on average 25 and 20 years later than usual, respectively. The numbers of colorectal adenomas differed markedly among affected individuals and the location of colorectal cancer lay frequently in the proximal colon. Our findings suggest that the exon 9 mutation identified in the pedigree is associated with late onset of FAP. The atypical phenotype may be explained by the site of the mutation in the APC gene. Analysis of the APC protein product indicated that the exon 9 mutation did not result in a detectable truncated APC protein. Given the location of the mutation within an alternatively spliced exon of APC, it is conceivable that normal APC proteins are produced from the mutant allele by alternative splicing.";"1996";"Human genetics";"Adenoma; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein; Adolescent; Adult; Age of Onset; Aged; Alternative Splicing; Blotting, Western; Colon; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Exons; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Frameshift Mutation; Genes, APC; Genetic Carrier Screening; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pedigree; Phenotype; Time Factors"

Prospective analysis of pathological prognostic factors in 209 resections for rectal carcinoma between 1988 and 1993 with meticulous pathological technique particularly to assess the relation of tumour to the peritoneal surface. Comprehensive clinical follow up with cause of death established from all available sources of information (hospital and general practitioner data) with necropsies where necessary. Local recurrence was determined by accepted clinical, radiological and pathological criteria. Local peritoneal involvement was detected in 25.8% (54/209) of cases. It was more common in women and was associated with tumour differentiation, size and site, and lymph node involvement. Local peritoneal involvement showed considerable prognostic disadvantage in all cases and in curative cases alone. Multivariate analysis demonstrated independent prognostic disadvantage for all cases although this was lost in the curative group. With a 30 month median follow up time, comprehensive clinical surveillance detected 25 (12.0%) local recurrences. Thirteen (52%) palliative cases had shown spread to involve the mesorectal (deep, circumferential) resection margin. Of the 12 curative cases, six were upper rectal cancers with local peritoneal involvement suggesting that tumour seeding into the pelvic peritoneal cavity was the cause of local recurrence. Local recurrence of the six other rectal tumours was probably because of intraluminal seeding in two, involvement of the distal margin in one, extensive extramural venous involvement in two, and tumour spread to the bladder in one. Comprehensive pathological analysis of a resection specimen can identify cases with a high probability of local recurrence which may benefit from early adjuvant therapy.

A retrospective analysis of rate and degree of lymph node metastasis was performed in each of the 275 patients, and survival rate was estimated in 197 patients who could be followed over a period of three years or more. In most of the curative operative cases of right colon cancer, metastasis to epicolic and paracolic nodes was restricted up to 10 cm proximal or distal to the tumor margin, and metastasis in the central direction was restricted up to main nodes. When cancer metastasized to infrapyloric lymph nodes, dissection of the nodes resulted in a higher rate of long-term prognosis. The five-year cumulative survival rates showed no statistically significant difference between any two of the N0 to N3 lymph node metastasis groups. The dissection procedure for right colon cancer involved removal of 10 cm of normal bowel both proximal and distal to the lesion and, in the central direction, dissection of regional lymph nodes along the main trunk artery up to main nodes, i.e., nodes situated anterior to the surgical trunk, which was confirmed to have a therapeutically satisfactory benefit. Infrapyloric lymph nodes must be dissected when metastasis to the nodes is suspected.

Operations for colorectal neoplasms accounted for two thirds of the procedures. The average age of patients was 63 years. Operations were performed in men and women with equal frequency. Right hemicolectomies and sigmoid colectomies were the most common operations (65.3%). On average, 77% of attempted procedures were converted to open operations. After the first 20 operations, however, the author maintained approximately a 90% success rate. The average length of operation for 542 successful laparoscopic-assisted operations was 170 minutes (range, 45-540 min). The average number of lymph nodes harvested from 226 laparoscopic specimens was 10.5 (range, 0-35). In 3 institutions, the yield of nodes in 80 laparoscopic specimens was 8.8, and in 88 open specimens, it was 7.5. The need for postoperative parenteral injections was decreased for patients after laparoscopic-assisted colorectal operations compared with open operations. The rate of major complications was 16.7% for 647 attempted laparoscopic-assisted operations, and the rate of mortality was 0.8%. The average length of postoperative stay after 543 successful laparoscopic-assisted colorectal operations was 5.9 days. Among 329 patients treated in private hospitals, the average postoperative length of stay was 4.7 days. The cost of laparoscopic-assisted operations was greater than that of open operations. The total cost of hospitalization for patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colorectal operations, however, was less than or approximately equal to that for open colorectal operations. The shortened stay offset the increased cost of operation. These results suggest that following laparoscopic-assisted colorectal operations, patients suffer fewer complications, decreased mortality, less pain, and shortened length of stay than patients after traditional open operations. These data, however, have been compiled from selected patients, and demonstration of these preliminary conclusions will require testing by randomized trials.";"1995";"The Gastroenterologist";"Colectomy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Hospital Costs; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumoperitoneum, Artificial; Postoperative Complications; Rectum; Time Factors"

We tested the Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction as an indicator of prognosis in a multivariate statistical analysis of 344 resected right-sided colonic cancers. Improved 5-year survival in univariate analysis was associated with low tumor grade, regular tubule configuration, expanding tumor growth pattern, prominent peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration, absence of tumoral invasion of extramural veins, all levels of intramural and extramural invasion short of widespread local tumor permeation, conspicuous Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, and absence of both nodal metastasis and nodal-independent tumor nodules in pericolic fat. By the Cox proportional hazard model using the stepwise method, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, and metastatic tumor nodules in pericolic fat retained independent prognostic significance. Combining the four variables to formulate pathological prognostic categories yielded a highly favorable prognostic group-92% 5-year survival and 95% confidence limits (88% to 96%)--encompassing 53% of the study population. It included all Dukes' stage A carcinomas, 66% of Dukes' stage B adenocarcinomas, and 11% of Dukes' stage C cancers. Lymph node metastases coupled with intramural and extramural extent of tumor invasion are the cornerstones of colorectal cancer staging. Addition of other variables improves prognostication for the cecum and ascending colon.

We reviewed the important preoperative, operative, and postoperative factors that should be considered for laparoscopic resection of the right, left, and sigmoid colon. The current indications for laparoscopic-assisted colectomy include most benign colonic conditions (such as colorectal polyps, rectal prolapse, diverticular disease, and colonic lipomas). Laparoscopic procedures for malignant disease, however, are currently reserved for prospective trials and palliation of patients with stage IV colonic cancer because the adequacy of staging and lymphatic resection remains questionable. Patients who are appropriate candidates for laparoscopic-assisted colectomy should be counseled about the potential benefits, risks, and possible need for conversion to an open surgical procedure--a decision that should be considered application of sound surgical judgment rather than a failure. For laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, we prefer to use the closed technique for establishing a pneumoperitoneum. We use a two-surgeon, four-cannula approach for resections of the right and left colon and a three-surgeon, five-cannula technique for resections of the sigmoid colon. Laparoscopic techniques are used to mobilize the bowel and divide the principal blood supply; the resection and anastomosis are performed extracorporeally, with use of a small incision. The associated morbidity and mortality rates are comparable to those for conventional open procedures. Despite a shortened period of ileus and fewer hospital days, the total costs for laparoscopic colectomy have been equivalent to those for standard colectomy. This result has generally been due to longer operative times, which should decrease with additional experience.";"1994";"Mayo Clinic proceedings";"Colectomy; Humans; Laparoscopy"

Six months after surgery, the mean daily stool frequency was two following subtotal colectomy and three after total colectomy. Emergency subtotal colectomy achieves in one stage relief of bowel obstruction and tumor resection by encompassing a massively distended and fecal-loaded colon with ischemic lesions and serosal tears on the cecum, ensures restoration of gut contiguity via a &quot;safe&quot; ileocolonic anastomosis, and removes occasional lesions proximal to the index cancer.

Dietary fats, altered bacterial flora, and secondary bile acids are considered to play a major role in the disease etiology. Gastric surgery is known to alter bile salt metabolism as well as bacterial flora in the colon. This cohort study was designed to investigate the risk of large bowel cancer following gastric surgery for benign ulcer disease and to identify potential patient and treatment characteristics that may be associated with this risk. A cohort of 15,983 males was selected from Department of Veterans Affairs hospital admissions in 1970 and 1971. The exposed group (n = 7,609) included all males treated with gastric surgery (resection or vagotomy and drainage) for benign ulcer disease. The unexposed group (n = 8,374) was a random sample of all other male patients from the same time period and database. All subjects were followed through 1989 to identify vital status and cause of death. Deaths were identifiable by computerized linkage of the subjects' social security numbers with the Department of Veterans Affairs Beneficiary Identification Record Locator System and the National Death Index. The cause of death was documented by two certified nosologists from the death certificates of 99% of the deceased patients. Statistical analyses included estimations of risk based on standardized mortality ratios and standardized risk ratios. In this selected cohort, no increase in large bowel cancer risk was detected (risk ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.62-1.05). The type of surgical procedure, ulcer diagnosis, age at the time of surgery, and length of follow-up did not alter the risk estimates. Unlike the previously identified increase in gastric cancer risk following ulcer surgery, no elevation in the risk of large bowel cancer following such surgery was detected in this study.

For adenocarcinoma of the rectum, strategies for adjuvant treatment are based primarily on pathologic stage alone, without consideration of presenting clinical factors. This analysis was undertaken to assess the effect of patient selection on results of adjunctive therapy. Three groups of patients with Astler-Coller Stage B2 and C rectal cancer were compared to assess the effect of patient selection factors on outcome of treatment after adjuvant postoperative radiation. Thirty-two patients in Group 1 received only 5 Gy preoperatively; 54 patients in Group 2 received low-dose (5 Gy) preoperative and high-dose (45 Gy) postoperative radiation; and 53 patients in Group 3 received high-dose (45 Gy) postoperative radiation. All patients have a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Whereas Group 1 and Group 2 patients were similar in distribution by clinical tumor characteristics, Group 3 had more patients with poor clinical features: higher median age, more men, and a higher proportion of tumors in the distal rectum. Group 3 also had a slightly higher percentage of C2 tumors compared with the other two groups. Treatment was well tolerated with minimal side effects. Patients in Group 1 had no long-term complications. Four percent of patients (2 of 54) in Group 2 and 6% of patients (3 of 53) in Group 3 experienced major small bowel complications. The incidence of local recurrence was 34% (11 of 32) in Group 1, 9% (5 of 54) in Group 2, and 21% (11 of 53) in Group 3.

Low-dose preoperative adjunctive radiation alone (Group 1) resulted in a high incidence of local recurrence and poor survival compared with patients treated more appropriately with low-dose preoperative plus adjunctive postoperative irradiation (Group 2). In spite of postoperative radiation, patients with clinically unfavorable rectal cancer (Group 3) did worse than carefully selected patients, although both were nominally Stage B2 and C.

In summary, this study supported those who consider the rectosigmoid junction cancers as a specific group, based on the particular association of the high frequency of intestinal obstruction and the low resectability rate, apparently related with a special anatomic localization, in a curved segment of the large bowel and suggests that these carcinomas do not constitute, in fact, a colo-rectal independent histopathologic entity.";"1994";"Acta medica portuguesa";"Aged; Chi-Square Distribution; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Portugal; Rectal Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Sigmoid Neoplasms"

The karyotypes were correlated with grade, stage, lymphocytic infiltration, and site (using the chi-square test), with patient age and tumor size (using the Student t test), and with survival (using the log-rank or Mantel-Haenszel test). Normal karyotypes were detected in 17, simple numeric changes in 22, and multiple structural and numeric abnormalities in 10. The most common numeric aberrations were +7, -Y, -18, and -22. The most common structural rearrangements were, in decreasing order of frequency, of chromosomes 1 (eight samples, leading to loss of 1p material in five), 3, 11, 17, 6, 8, 13, and 20. Marked or moderate lymphocytic infiltration was seen significantly less often (P &lt; 0.05) in tumors with complex chromosomal abnormalities than in those with simple anomalies or normal karyotypes. The subset of patients who had tumors with multiple chromosomal abnormalities had a significantly shorter survival time (P &lt; 0.025) than those who had lesions with simple changes or normal karyotypes. Loss of 1p material is the most consistent chromosomal change in colorectal carcinomas but probably represents a progressional rather than a primary event. Structural changes of chromosomes 3 and 11 seem to be more common in tumors located in the distal part of the large intestine. The significantly shorter survival time of patients with complex aberrations indicates that the karyotype could be used as a prognostic parameter in patients with colorectal cancer.";"1993";"Cancer";"Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chromosome Aberrations; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Gene Deletion; Gene Rearrangement; Humans; Male; Middle Aged"

Prohibitive mortality rates, however, are ascribed to such an approach. Analyzing the Senior Author's experience we compared the one-stage approach versus the multi-stage resections concerning operative mortality and morbidity rates and the duration of hospitalization. Forty-nine of 291 (17%) large bowel cancers presented acute left-sided obstruction requiring emergency surgery. Colostomy alone was performed in 18 (37%), multi-stage colectomy in 20 (41%, Group A) and one-stage subtotal colectomy in 11 (22%, Group B, all of them after 1979), the years under scrutiny being from 1973 through Sept. 1990. Both groups were comparable in age and sex distribution, TNM staging and ASA classification. Operative mortality and morbidity rates were 10% and 30% in Group A, 9% and 18% in Group B, respectively. The average length of hospitalization was 21.25 days (14-30) in Group A, 9.18 days (7-14) in Group B. Whenever an experienced surgical team is available and in the absence of contra-indications (local factors precluding a swift dissection, hemodynamic instability, gangrenous bowel) a one-stage subtotal colectomy, taking advantage of a better healing ileo-sigmoid or ileo-rectal anastomosis, carries acceptable mortality and morbidity rates while enhancing the quality of life and shortening the length of hospitalization. It should be considered the choice procedure, provided selection requirements and technical demands are met. An evaluation of the Senior Author's team experience (1973-90) in the management of acutely obstructing left colon cancer (49/291 or 17%) provides information on multi-stage resections and one-stage subtotal colectomy (Group A and B) as regards operative mortality (10% in Group A, 9% in Group B) as well as length of hospitalization (21 days in Group A, 9 days in Group B).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";"1992";"Acta medica portuguesa";"Acute Disease; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colectomy; Colonic Diseases; Colonic Neoplasms; Colostomy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Risk"

Whatever the aetiology, the pathophysiology of large bowel obstruction has clinical significance. Changes in motility augmented by increased colonic blood flow may play a role in dissemination of tumour cells and/or bacteria. Intravascular fluid depletion, especially shortly after intestinal decompression, has important haemodynamic implications. The diagnosis is often confirmed on plain abdominal X-ray, but water-soluble contrast studies are important in distinguishing a mechanical obstruction (which almost always requires an operation) from a pseudo-obstruction (which can usually be managed without surgery). Mortality and morbidity may be reduced by optimization of the patient's condition both before and after the operation using intensive care facilities and by careful timing of surgery. The surgical management of malignant large bowel obstruction is best directed by a senior surgeon. For tumours up to and including the splenic flexure, an extended right hemicolectomy is advisable since it offers adequate removal of the tumour and allows an immediate safe ileocolic anastomosis. More distal tumours should be resected if possible, and there is much to recommend on-table irrigation and immediate anastomosis, although a colostomy with a mucous fistula or Hartmann's procedure still have a place. Endoscopic diagnosis and decompression enables definitive surgery to be undertaken electively and several techniques are being evaluated. Non-operative reduction of sigmoid volvulus by rigid or flexible endoscopy is achieved with high success rates, but is not recommended for caecal volvulus. Resection is usually necessary in both to prevent recurrence. Mortality of colonic volvulus is closely related to bowel viability. Uncomplicated colonic pseudo-obstruction may be managed medically or by endoscopic decompression. It often occurs in association with systemic medical conditions, which need to be treated vigorously. Surgery is indicated if there are signs of impending or frank perforation, or if non-operative measures fail.";"1991";"Bailliere's clinical gastroenterology";"Colonic Diseases; Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Emergencies; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Resuscitation"

In 19 of the 25 patients, all carcinomas in the individual colon had identical nuclear DNA distribution patterns. Aneuploid tumors tended to appear more frequently in the sigmoid colon and the rectum than in the right colon. Carcinomas associated with an adenoma were more common in the rectum and in Dukes' A carcinomas. The results of cytometric assessments of the nuclear DNA ploidy pattern of the neoplastic cells in colorectal carcinomas have previously been found to be an independent prognostic variable. From the observations made in the present study, it is concluded that the cytometric DNA ploidy pattern of multiple primary colorectal carcinomas corresponds to that found in single carcinomas.

Lastly, two patients received a graft for secondary cancer from a colonic adenocarcinoma and a carcinoid tumour of the right colon. The operative mortality was nil for the transplantations for cancer in a normal liver, but there were 4 deaths out of the 11 cases of cancer secondary to cirrhosis. The actuarial survival of the overall series was 55% at 1 year and 31% at 2 years. The poorest survival was observed for cancers in a normal liver, with the exception of the fibrolamellar cancer in which recurrence was delayed. The longest survival was observed for cancers secondary to cirrhosis. At three years, the results of liver transplantation were equal to those of hepatic resections with a survival of 37%, despite the fact that the transplantation was generally performed for very large tumours.";"1991";"Annales de chirurgie";"Adult; Female; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Diseases; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged"

This is the usual site of complications where the etiology is related to diverticular infection associated with fecal impaction proximal to the high pressure zone at the recto-sigmoid junction.

Between 1964 and 1980, 1042 patients underwent exploratory surgery for colorectal cancer. Of these, 58 patients (5.5%) underwent curative multivisceral resection for suspected contiguous invasion by the primary tumor. Follow-up was complete for all patients. The primary tumors were located in the rectum (38 patients), sigmoid (9 patients), left colon (6 patients), and right colon (5 patients). En bloc resection of other viscera included uterus, adnexa, bladder, vagina, small intestine, abdominal wall, liver, stomach, kidney, and ureter. The operative morbidity and mortality rates were 31% and 1.7%, respectively. Resection margins were free of tumor in 54 patients. In the four patients with tumor-positive resection margins, recurrence of disease was evident between 8 and 22 weeks after surgery (mean survival time, 8.2 months). Carcinomatous invasion of the resected contiguous organ was confirmed in 49 patients (84%). The mean survival time for patients without lymph node metastases was 100.7 months, but it was only 16.2 months (p less than 0.01) for patients with lymph node metastases. Actuarial 5-year disease-free survival rate for patients without lymph node metastases was 76% (36 of 47 patients). None of the patients (0 of 11) with lymph node metastases survived for 5 years. Three of 36 of the 5-year survivors experienced recurrence of disease before the seventh postoperative year; no cancer-related deaths occurred between 7 and 25 years. These data suggest that survival in locally advanced colorectal carcinoma is more dependent on lymph node status than on the extent of local invasion. Effective disease control associated with survival in the long term can be achieved by multivisceral resection.";"1990";"Surgery";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Complications; Reoperation; Survival Analysis; Time Factors"

Aneuploidy was more frequently encountered in distal tumors. Preoperative CEA, histologic differentiation, Dukes' stage, and ploidy were individually associated with overall survival. In Dukes' A, B, and C tumors, patients with normal and elevated CEA had no significant difference in overall survival. A relationship was apparent between disease-free survival and site, histologic differentiation, Dukes' stage, and ploidy. Multivariate overall survival analysis did not reveal independent prognostic significance of ploidy when all Dukes' stages were considered. In contrast, Dukes' stage, differentiation, and ploidy were good indicators of higher risk of colorectal cancer-related death in patients undergoing curative surgery.

According to this concept tumours of the right half of the colon are primarily resected in the form of a right hemicolectomy; tumours of the left flexure undergo a two stage and those distal to the left flexure a three stage procedure. These principles were consistently applied in our patients and this resulted in an operative mortality of 0% after excluding patients who had a primary septic condition.

Palliative surgeries (colostomies, internal derivations) used in patients with nonresectable tumours were followed by the highest surgical mortality, a consequence of the biological substrate weakened by disease and complications. The data reported show the necessity of a selective tactical behaviour in the emergency surgery of rectocolonic cancer and plead for the primary urgent colectomy in the patients meeting certain general and local conditions.

In the obstructed group no patient had Dukes' stage A vs. 9.6% in the nonobstructed patients, and 22% of the obstructed patients had Dukes' D vs. 14% of the nonobstructed patients. The 5-year survival in Dukes' A was 82%, while no survivors were found for Dukes' D. The crude 5-year survival rate was 22.4% in the obstructed patients and 49.1% in the nonobstructed patients; in-hospital mortality was 22.4% and 6.8%, respectively, and the adjusted actuarial survival was 39% vs. 64%, respectively. Curative resection was performed in 68% of the obstructed and 83% of the nonobstructed patients. The adjusted actuarial 5-year survival rates for these patients were 53% and 76%, respectively. The criteria for the tumor grade tested in this study, which included differentiation of the tumor cells, size, and the presence of perforation, did not influence the survival. Twenty-one patients underwent primary resection, 15 had stage resection, and 9 had diversion procedures. The in-hospital mortality rates were 35% for primary resection and diversion procedures and 7% for stage resection. The crude 5-year survival was 32% for primary resection, 42% for stage resection (not statistically significant), and 0 for diversion procedures. The poor prognosis for the obstructed patients in our study was mainly related to 1) high in-hospital mortality, 2) the lower rate of curative resection, 3) unequal distribution of the tumor site, and 4) to a small extent, the difference in Dukes' stage.";"1989";"Journal of surgical oncology";"Actuarial Analysis; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Rectal Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors"

Well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, less than 2 cm in diameter, and well-differentiated polypoid adenocarcinomas, less than 4 cm in diameter, were all found in patients with Dukes' stage A tumors.

National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project.";"Abdominoperineal resections for rectal carcinoma are being performed with decreasing frequency in favor of sphincter-saving resections. It remains, however, to be unequivocally demonstrated that sphincter preservation has not resulted in compromised local disease control, disease-free survival, and survival. Accordingly, it is the specific aim of this endeavor to compare local recurrence, disease-free survival, and survival in patients with Dukes' B and C rectal cancer undergoing curative abdominoperineal resection or sphincter-saving resection. For the purpose of this study, 232 patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection and 181 subjected to sphincter-saving resections were available for analysis from an NSABP randomized prospective clinical trial designed to ascertain the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in rectal carcinoma (protocol R-01). The mean time on study was 48 months. Analyses were carried out comparing the two operations according to Dukes' class, the number of positive nodes, and tumor size. The only significant differences in disease-free survival and survival were observed for the cohort characterized by greater than 4 positive nodes and were in favor of patients treated with sphincter-saving resections. A patient undergoing sphincter-saving resection was 0.62 times as likely to sustain a treatment failure as a similar patient undergoing abdominoperineal resection (p = 0.07) and 0.49 times as likely to die (p = 0.02). The inability to demonstrate an attenuated disease-free survival and survival for patients treated with sphincter-saving resection was in spite of an increased incidence of local recurrence (anastomotic and pelvic) observed for the latter operation when compared to abdominoperineal resection (13% vs. 5%). A similar analysis evaluating the length of margins of resection in patients undergoing sphincter-preserving operations indicated that treatment failure and survival were not significantly different in patients whose distal resection margins were less than 2 cm, 2-2.9 cm, or greater than or equal to 3 cm. If any trend was observed, it appeared that patients with smaller resection margins had a slightly prolonged survival (p = 0.10). This observation was present in spite of the fact that local recurrence as a first site of treatment failure was greater in the group with less than 2 cm that it was in the greater than or equal to 3 cm category, 22% versus 12%. This increased local recurrence rate in the population with smaller margins was not translated into an in crease in overall treatment failure and had absolutely no influence on survival. It is suggested that local recurrence serves as a marker of distant disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)";"1986";"Annals of surgery";"Anal Canal; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Perineum; Prospective Studies; Random Allocation; Rectal Neoplasms"

Most patients with colorectal cancer were men (2:1), and had extensive (90%) and long-lasting colitis (10 years or more in 93% of cases; mean 18 years). Colitis was inactive before the diagnosis of cancer in 48%. Acute onset of the first attack was rare (7%), and the disease had a remittent course in 92%. The mean age at diagnosis of cancer was 43 years. The cumulative risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher in patients with extensive colitis than in those with left-sided disease (P less than 0.0001: 11.9% vs. 1.8% at 20 years and 25.3% vs. 3.7% at 30 years). When comparing mean duration of disease, left-sided colitis (22 years) did not differ significantly from extensive disease. The tumor was multifocal in 13.5%, proximal to the splenic flexure in 44%, and poorly differentiated in 34% of the cases. The diagnosis was suspected clinically in 64% of cases. The prognosis of colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis appears to be similar to that in the general population. The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 54%. This study supports the concept that surveillance colonoscopy should be started after 8 to 10 years of extensive colitis and after 15 years of left-sided colitis. Among those with extracolonic malignancy, the incidence of bile duct carcinoma, leukemia, bone tumors, and endometrial cancer was significantly greater than expected (P less than 0.01), whereas that of lung cancer was significantly lower than expected (P less than 0.01).";"1986";"Cancer";"Adolescent; Adult; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Child; Colitis, Ulcerative; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Leukemia; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Multiple Primary; Rectal Neoplasms; Risk; Uterine Neoplasms"

Rate of tumor growth is never consistent in patients with this disease. Patients who develop colon obstruction early in the course of the disease seem to have more aggressive tumors with rapid growth and a much poorer long-term prognosis. Perforations frequently accompany obstructions of the colon. Patients in this group have a dismal prognosis. Individuals with obstructed carcinoma of the colon have a higher operative mortality and morbidity and a shorter long-term survival. The higher operative mortality and morbidity may depend entirely on the choice of operative procedures. Tumor location affects prognosis. Obstructing tumors in the left colon have a more favorable prognosis than those in the right colon. Obstructing right colon tumors have a much poorer survival (three times worse) than nonobstructing carcinomas of the right colon. Obstructing tumors in the rectum have a very poor prognosis. Evidence exists that resection of the tumor without preliminary proximal decompression may reduce hospital mortality and morbidity and increase long-term survival. In selected cases, primary resection can be done as safely as staged operative procedures. Primary anastomosis with resection of the left colon carries a higher operative mortality because of anastomotic leaks. Resection without anastomosis is much safer. Primary resection with anastomosis is the procedure of choice in obstructing lesions of the right colon. This has a lower operative mortality and morbidity than a staged procedure. This primary resection with anastomosis is certainly as safe as an ileotransverse colostomy. It is important not to abandon the time-honored surgical principle of never suturing obstructed bowel. Primary resection without anastomosis confirms this surgical principle. Meticulous preoperative and postoperative care employing physiological monitoring, multiple antibiotics, total parenteral hyperalimentation, and respiratory and circulatory support will further reduce the hospital mortality and morbidity. Patients who initially appear to be obstructed on barium enema, but who in truth are only partially obstructed, can be properly managed so that an elective primary resection with anastomosis can be done with the same operative mortality and morbidity as in other elective colon cancer patients.";"1986";"The Surgical clinics of North America";"Aged; Colonic Diseases; Colonic Neoplasms; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Intestinal Perforation; Intestine, Small; Male; Methods; Preoperative Care; Prognosis"

In obstructing carcinomas of the right colon, immediate resection of the lesion with ileocolonic anastomosis is acceptable. The scope of right hemicolectomy can be extended to encompass obstructing carcinomas of the left colon by performing subtotal or total colectomy with ileosigmoid or ileorectal anastomosis. Herein, we have reported the outcome in 16 patients treated in this manner. The operative mortality was 12.5 percent, which compared favorably the mortality of other methods of surgical management. Extended right hemicolectomy achieves in one operation relief of intestinal obstruction, tumor resection, restoration of gut continuity, elimination of the risks of synchronous or metachronous colonic tumors, and a possible increase in the 5 year survival rate.

The obstructive patients were older than the elective ones, with a statistically significant difference in the age range 80 years and older. Obstructive lesions were mainly located in the left hemicolon (56%). Although the sigmoid was the most frequent site, only lesions at the splenic flexure occurred more frequently than in patients without obstruction. Lesions in the right hemicolon were predominant in obstructive patients younger than 50 years. The overall 5-year survival for patients with obstructions was 21% but only 8% in those younger than 50 years. The corresponding figures for elective patients were 44% and 53%, respectively. The poorer overall prognosis in the obstruction group was mainly due to a higher postoperative mortality (15.4% vs. 4.7%) and a higher incidence of advanced cancer (stage C + D; 67% vs. 50%). Advanced disease was especially predominant in patients below the age of 50 years. However, this group had no operative mortality. A one-stage operation was performed only for obstructive lesions in the right hemicolon where it was the main (54%) procedure. Obstruction due to cancer in the left hemicolon were managed by Hartmann's procedure and a staged operation with almost equal frequency in 80% of the patients. Crude survival figures favour the staged operation. Obstructive lesions in the left hemicolon had a considerably better 5-year survival than those in the right hemicolon (29% vs. 15%), whereas none of those with rectal obstruction survived for 5 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";"1984";"Annales chirurgiae et gynaecologiae";"Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Rectal Neoplasms"

II.";"Metastatic cancer of the liver has a dominant influence upon survival despite the presence of metastasis in other sites. For patients with untreated liver metastases, the median survival after diagnosis is 75 days, and only 7% survived 1 year. Prognosis of hepatic metastasis is related to the extent of liver involvement, and various staging systems have been proposed (Table I.1). Hepatic metastases are quite resistant to conventional systemic chemotherapy. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice whenever possible, but the resectability rate is rather low and the surgical mortality relatively high. Patients with solitary metastasis and those with primary in the colon, especially females, have had the best results. Regional chemotherapy to the liver has the advantages of achieving higher local concentrations of drug, prolonging the contact of drug and tumor cells, and reducing systemic toxicity. Infusion catheter can be placed either percutaneously or directly at the time of celiotomy. Many reports show that hepatic IA infusion of chemotherapeutic agents (5FU or FUDR) can give favorable response in 55%-80% of the cases and can prolong survival in comparison with untreated patients or patients receiving systemic chemotherapy (Tables I.2 and I.3). Some investigators have added one or more other agents to improve the therapeutic results. For instance, patients who were refractory to 5FU or MMC given as a single IV drug responded to the combination infusion therapy. Evidence from animal and human studies have demonstrated that both primary and metastatic tumors in the liver receive their blood supply almost exclusively from the hepatic arterial system, whereas normal liver tissue has a double supply: the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Thus, deliberate ligation of the hepatic artery has been used as a treatment of metastatic tumors of the liver. From 1966 to 1981, some 518 patients were reported to have undergone this operation as compared to 2327 patients treated with hepatic IA infusion chemotherapy (Table I.4). Although selective necrosis of tumor nodules has been demonstrated after HAL, there is always a shell of viable malignant cells left at the periphery. Thus, several series have administered chemotherapeutic agents either to the distal hepatic artery or to branches of the portal vein to prevent tumor regrowth. Currently there is no definite evidence that HAL with added infusion chemotherapy to the liver gives better response and/or survival results than infusion chemotherapy via the hepatic artery only and/or via the portal vein branches. The availability of a totally implantable infusion pump represents a remarkable advance in long-term i";"1984";"Cancer investigation";"Hepatic Artery; Hot Temperature; Humans; Ligation; Liver Neoplasms; Neoplasm Metastasis"

The majority of late deaths (those occurring after five years) resulted from cancer in the descending colon, sigmoid colon or rectum rather than from cancer in the right or transverse colon. For example, among all patients with cancer of the rectum, 15.4% of those with Dukes' B tumors and 10.9% of those with Dukes' C tumors died of rectal cancer between five and ten years after diagnosis. When late survival rates were compared, patients with right and transverse colon cancer (8 deaths/93 at risk) fared significantly better than those with left colon and rectal cancer (33 deaths/171 at risk; P = 0.01). Among patients with left-sided colon and rectal carcinoma, a further significant difference in late survival was found when stage of disease was considered: patients with Dukes' A cancers (3 deaths/47 at risk after five years) fared better than those with Dukes' C cancers (21 deaths/74 at risk) (P = 0.002). For Dukes' B and C stages of disease, patients with left colon and rectal cancer fared worse than those with right and transverse colon lesions after 60 months. Of all patients who died of large bowel cancer after five years, 69% had a recurrence of cancer by 60 months, and most late recurrences were located in the descending and sigmoid colon and in the rectum. These results show differences in survival after five years with respect to both site of cancer in the colon and stage of initial disease.

In our group of patients, a ratio of 16.-2:4.4 months was observed. Resection of the oesophagus with primary oesophagogastric anastomosis is the most simple method with one anastomosis only. This method was uniformly used in all our patients. Reconstruction with interposition of the colon is technically more demanding. We have utilized it in two cases only. Resection of the oesophagus and staged reconstruction are less troublesome for the patient and decrease the operative risk, but markedly prolong the entire therapeutic procedure. The technique employed in lesions involving the cardia and distal part of the oesophagus includes a left transthoracic and transdiaphragmatic approach. In higher oesophageal carcinoma, mobilization of the stomach is made through laparotomy and followed by a right transthoracic and, if need be, right transcervical resection of the oesophagus. The majority of surgeons share the view that resection of the oesophagus with a malignant lesion is potentially curative, but many of them, however, regard this procedure as affording exclusively palliation. In our series, the five-year survival rate was 21.7%. The treatment of choice should employ the simplest technique available for a radical resection and reconstruction in one stage, account for the lowest postoperative morbidity and mortality possible and afford a prompt relief of dysphagia. We also advocate a deliberate palliative resection for ist being the only palliative procedure which markedly increases the survival of patients.";"1983";"Acta chirurgica Iugoslavica";"Aged; Esophageal Neoplasms; Humans; Methods; Middle Aged"

Seven patients with C. septicum gangrene or sepsis have been treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the years 1977-79. All of these patients have had associated malignant disease: four patients had colon adenocarcinomas, two patients had acute myeloblastic leukemias, and one patient had breast carcinoma. In six of the seven patients, the malignancy was in an advanced state; the breast carcinoma showed no evidence of recurrence after mastectomy, 17 years earlier. A bowel portal of entry is postulated in five patients. Despite prompt use of appropriate antibiotics, the only survivors were two of the four patients who underwent early extensive debridement. These results suggest that, in the patient with C. septicum infection, malignancy should be sought; that, in the septic patient with known malignancy, C. septicum should be considered; and that, in the absence of external source in the patient with clostridial myonecrosis or sepsis, the cecum or distal ileum should be considered a likely site of infection.

Moreover, beside the original indications, this type of intervention can also be aplied in the case of some other benign lesions, and extension of the colon resection may involve other areas beside the recto-sigmoid zone. The specific indications of the intervention are the severe, very extensive and usually complicated lesions of the colon, frequently associated with a general biologic deterioration, conditions that make highly improbably the success of other surgical procedures. In a group of 28 patients (4,6 percent of the total number of cases in which interventions on the colon have been performed), of which 15 neoplasies and 13 benign lesions, the following resections have been carried out: 19 sigmoid resections, one resection of the transverse colon, 3 rectosigmoid resections, one left hemi-colectomy, 2 sub-total colectomies, 2 interventions for dehiscence of anastomoses. Considering the critical condition of the patients the high post-operative mortality appears to be easy to explain, as well as the non-lethal septic post-operative complications. In 7 patients (25 percent of the survivors) secondary restoration of the transit was carried out (4 benign lesions, and 3 cases of neoplasy).

Primary obstructing tumors of the small bowel are treated best by resection and primary anastomosis. Malignant lesions of the duodenum sometimes will require pancreaticoduodenectomy and those of the distal ileum, right hemicolectomy. Obstruction due to localized metastatic disease can be treated by resection and primary anastomosis but, more frequently, one or more side-to-side enteroenterostomies will be needed, especially in abdominal carcinomatosis. The complication of LBO due to colorectal cancer is an ominous sign. The less favorable prognosis is a result of the higher operative mortality, advanced stage of disease and lower resectability rate. Obstructing neoplasms of the right side of the colon are treated best by immediate resection and primary anastomosis. Left-sided colon obstruction due to malignancy traditionally is treated by preliminary diversion followed later by definitive resection. Insufficient data are available to evaluate any benefit on operative mortality and long-term survival with a more aggressive approach involving decompression and resection of the obstructing carcinoma at the initial operation. It is doubtful that any marked improvement in current mortality and survival figures will result from wide deviations of the current principles of operative managment. Early diagnosis of the cancer before obstruction occurs remains the primary means of improving survival rates. This involves not only primary means of improving survival rates. This involves not only patient education regarding presenting symptoms, but improvement of physician recognition and response to these complaints so that the appropriate tests are ordered and treatment is initiated.";"1980";"Current problems in cancer";"Humans; Intestinal Neoplasms; Intestinal Obstruction; Intestine, Large; Intestine, Small; Neoplasms; Prognosis"

Size, location, and histologic invasiveness have been shown to correlate with regional and remote metastasis in previous series. We reviewed 81 patients with gastrointestinal carcinoids seen at the Medical University of South Carolina Teaching Hospitals since 1950. An unusual case of a 0.5 cm primary ileal carcinoid with widespread intra-abdominal and hepatic metastases is documented. In this series carcinoids were found (in order of decreasing frequency) in the ileum, appendix, rectum, right colon, duodenum, jejunum, stomach, ampulla of Vater, sigmoid colon, and pancreas. Metastases were found in 17% of the overall group. Two carcinoids presented with intussusception, while one was found within a Meckel's diverticulum. In addition to the small metastatic ileal carcinoid, one patient with a rectal carcinoid measuring 0.4 cm was found to have metastases after low anterior resection. Because all extra-appendiceal gastrointestinal carcinoids are potentially metastatic, it is stressed that regional lymphadenectomy en bloc with primary excision is the treatment of choice wherever feasible. If the lesion is small or has not invaded deeply, local excision with close follow-up may be an acceptable alternative.";"1979";"Southern medical journal";"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Carcinoid Tumor; Female; Humans; Intestinal Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis"

Only 13 cases have been previously reported, occurring from 10 to 46 yr after the procedure. In a series of 150 patients who have had ureterosigmoidostomies carried out at the Children's Hospital Medical Center, Boston, over the past 40 yr, 4 patients have been treated at our institution for this complication. The tumor was noted 20 to 32 yr after the initial procedure. Two patients are alive and well 1 and 4 yr after resection. The increasing incidence of this complication with advancing age will require careful observation and will undoubtedly influence the indications for the procedure. An additional question of great importance is how to evaluate and follow the thousands of patients who have had this procedure done at one time in their lives. It is suggested that an annual intravenous pyelogram is indicated in those patients with functioning ureterostomies and that a colonoscopy to the level of the anastomoses be carried out at 6-mo intervals in all patients. In those patients in whom the ureterosigmoidostomies have been taken down, a sleeve resection of that area of the colon should be strongly considered.";"1979";"Journal of pediatric surgery";"Adenocarcinoma; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Bladder Exstrophy; Child; Child, Preschool; Colon, Sigmoid; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk; Sigmoid Neoplasms; Time Factors; Urinary Diversion"

The commonest methods of clinical discovery of recurrence included findings of abdominal and pelvic masses, hepatomegaly, and positive chest films. The average survival after discovery of recurrence was only eleven months, but 23 patients having reresections for cure lived an average of thirty-three months. Seven patients (30%) undergoing reresection for cure represented probable cures. Chemotherapy with intravenous 5-FU provided poor palliation, but radiotherapy gave satisfactory relief of symptoms in approximately 50% of patients, particularly those with rectal or low colon lesions.

Because of the extremely high incidence of advanced tumors in patients with metachronous disease, every effort should be made to identify those patients who should undergo a preventive total abdominal colectomy.

Mortality data for 11,635 colorectal cancers in the state of Kansas for this period confirm this trend (P less than .0001). The respective decrease and increase may well be the result of more than one factor. Results of digital examination of the rectum and sigmoidoscopy are less likely to diagnose large-bowel cancer as they did 30 years ago.

Excluded from this analysis were patients treated by abdominoperineal resection, local excision, fulguration, or abdominoperineal pull-through procedures. Ninety-one patients were treated by local segmental resection and 16 by left hemicolectomy. Both groups were similar in regard to patient age and general health, lesion size, location, and pathological Duke's classification. Five-year survival was 70.3% after local segmental resection and 56.3% after left hemicolectomy. Hospital mortality was 1% after the former and 6.2% after the latter. Rate of recurrence after local segmental resection was 41% of that seen after left hemicolectomy, while complications were one-third as great. The present results after local segmental resection are comparable to the results reported in the literature when hemicolectomy was the procedure used.

The most frequent symptoms were nonspecific and caused by anemia which, in some instances, were treated without adequate investigation. The standard and most appropriate treatment for carcinoma of the cecum is a right hemicolectomy with ileotranversostomy and, when necessary and feasible, en bloc resection of involved parts of the abdominal wall. In the absence of nodal disease or distant metastases, extension to the abdominal wall does not adversely influence the prognosis. The surgeon must remain aware of the possibility of coexisting carcinoma of the cecum and appendicitis. Any patient with a mass or a persistent draining sinus after an appendectomy or drainage of an appendical abscess should be suspected of having carcinoma of the cecum. The over-all five year survival rate in this series is 33%, and if curative resections alone are considered, it is 44%, with an operative mortality of 3%.
